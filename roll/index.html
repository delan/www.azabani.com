<p>A selection of blogs and other websites that I find interesting enough to
follow avidly.

<h2><a href="http://bellard.org">Fabrice Bellard's Home Page</a></h2>

<p>To be described as a genius would be a grossly deficient appraisement of
Fabrice Bellard, the creator of FFmpeg and QEMU. Being everything a hacker
aspires to, he has won the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC</a> twice, and
in his spare time has written <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/">a PC
emulator in JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://bellard.org/dvbt/">a DVB-T
transmitter by abusing a VGA controller</a> and much more.

<h2><a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/">The Old New Thing</a></h2>

<p>A Windows veteran of over two decades, Raymond Chen gives the masses an
insight into just how far Microsoft has to bend over backwards for
naughty third party developers depending on bugs and undocumented APIs,
as backwards compatibility is carefully maintained.

<h2><a href="http://davec.org">Dave's Archives</a></h2>

<p>The blog of David Cooper, a software engineering lecturer at Curtin
University, two of whose units I have had the pleasure of studying. With a
sharp wit and a particularly keen sense for Australian politics, Dave never
fails to provoke thought after reading.

<h2><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a></h2>

<p>Master software engineer and co-creator of Stack Overflow, Joel Spolsky has
had me hooked since opening my eyes to the simultaneously infuriating and
wonderful world of text with <a href=
"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum
Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and
Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Raw Thought</a></h2>

<p>While I've followed Aaron Swartz's insightful and highly heterogeneous
writing since well before 2013, posthumous examination of his prose gains a
new dimension in light of the atrocious miscarriage of justice against him.
