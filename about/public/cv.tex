	\vspace{0.2em}  \\                              & Implemented web platform features in Chromium (C++) and Servo (Rust), contributed to web platform specifications via the CSS Working Group, spoke at conferences including BlinkOn and the Web Engines Hackfest, and actively built a healthy worker’s cooperative.
	\\              \\  \textbf{2020}               & \textbf{Software developer} at Automattic
	\vspace{0.2em}  \\                              & Developed and supported VaultPress (PHP), a legacy backup and malware scanning service for WordPress, and Rewind (TypeScript), its successor, both involving remote access components that build a reliable runtime out of unreliable parts (customer sites).
	\vspace{0.2em}  \\                              & Wrote a paginating MySQL dumper to copy tables from customer sites where mysqldump(1) and replication are unavailable. Migrated the Rewind monorepo ($\sim$50 kloc across three packages) from npm to yarn, enabling the team to publish a shared library package.
	\vspace{0.2em}  \\                              & Caught and investigated several data integrity bugs in the complex interactions between text and binary data encodings. Revamped backup filesystem handling to safely work with non-Unicode paths.
