I’m a computer programmer based in Perth, Australia. My passions include all
kinds of systems programming from [Rust] to [x86 assembly] and beyond,
internationalisation and [Unicode], digital preservation and archaeology,
typography, cryptography, and above all, [teaching]. I’m also a trans woman
(she/her pronouns)!

When I’m away from my computer, I enjoy [cooking], [speedrunning], solving [cubes], [folk punk], and [road trips].
I moved to Sydney for work in 2017, but at last I’m back in Perth where I belong.

I’ve worked with a wide range of stacks at a wide range of levels, including
frontend and backend web development, builds and releases, sysadmin and devops,
databases and directories, and performance analysis.

Before that I was a [tutor] and computer science student at [Curtin University],
and the president of its [Computer Science Students Association].
