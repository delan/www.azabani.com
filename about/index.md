My passions include all kinds of systems programming from [Rust] to [x86 assembly] and beyond,
internationalisation and [Unicode], [digital preservation] and [retrocomputing],
typography, cryptography, and above all, [teaching].

When I’m away from my computer, I enjoy [cooking], solving [cubes], [folk punk], [road trips], and [speedrunning].
I currently hold world record times in [<em>Super Solvers: Gizmos &amp; Gadgets!</em>], which I achieved by [reverse][reverse] [engineering][engineering] the game and writing a [route planner].

I’ve worked with a wide range of stacks at a wide range of levels, including
frontend and backend web development, builds and releases, sysadmin and devops,
databases and directories, and performance analysis.

My current day job is developing browsers and web standards at [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com).
Before that I was a [tutor] and computer science student at [Curtin University],
and the president of its [Computer Science Students Association].
