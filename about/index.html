title: About Delan
---

<p>I am a second year computer science student at <a
href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/">Curtin University</a>, and a committee member
of its <a href="http://www.comssa.org.au/">Computer Science Students
Association</a>.

<p>I'm a mad scientist regardless of the Sun's position relative to Earth.
Undeterred by possible practical applications, anything is fair game as long as
it satisfies some intellectual curiosity.

<p>I'm also an active user of <a href="https://github.com/delan">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/u/330644">Stack Overflow</a>. Unless
