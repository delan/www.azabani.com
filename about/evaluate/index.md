Teaching staff at Curtin University may opt into receiving anonymous
feedback from students for any given unit each semester. One could
argue that this is flawed, because the staff who need the most
improvement will rarely opt in, but that it exists is pretty neat.

While I obviously don't know who you are, I'd like to thank every
student who took the time to give me feedback. Your praise is
invigorating, and your criticism will directly improve the experience
of my students in coming years.
