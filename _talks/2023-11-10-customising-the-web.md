The ability for users to customise the websites they use is something that empowers them to interact with the web on their own terms, and this is a big part of what makes a browser a *user agent*.

This talk explains why user customisation is important for the web, with a focus on userstyles, userscripts, and bookmarklets. I analyse how people use them, point out what we can learn from those use cases, demonstrate how you can use them yourself, explain their limitations, and discuss how we can make them better.
