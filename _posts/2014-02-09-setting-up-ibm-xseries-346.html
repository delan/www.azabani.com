<p>I recently acquired an IBM eServer from a friend, type 8840. I've repurposed
it to be a dedicated Debian box at the moment, but there were some issues. At
infrequent intervals, maybe once a day, the server would reboot for no reason,
and no OS or firmware logs showed a trace. Perhaps it's something raising a
non-maskable interrupt. In an effort to fix that I've updated all of the
firmware I could find.

<p>Updating the main BIOS to version 1.17 was straightforward with the <a href=
"http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=migr-57074"
>KPE144A CD image</a>. Similarly easy was version 1.20 of the baseboard
management controller firmware, with the <a href=
"http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-57034"
>KPBT37A CD image</a>. Both are essentially floppy disk images with PC-DOS,
standard fare for firmware updates.

<p>I then discovered that in addition to the BMC, the server comes with what
IBM calls a "Remote Supervisor Adapter", or RSA II. Essentially this small blue
board with a PowerPC CPU and its own Ethernet port is out-of-band management on
steroids.

<p>In addition to using DHCP and providing its own HTTP and SSH servers even
without a running OS on the host, it allows you to monitor sensors, check logs,
reboot, and even interact with the local console. There's essentially no need
to ever physically touch the server other than to replace faulty parts.

<p>Updating the RSA II was a little trickier. The provided update, <a href=
"http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-56757"
>KPEP30A</a> simply contains the firmware image files themselves, which you
need to upload via the board's web interface. Without the username and password
set by a distant old owner though, that was not possible. The Linux release of
the update, which is a hacky shell script blob, doesn't even work when I tried
it on Debian 7 amd64, probably because it's so old.

<p>The main challenge to tackle then, was resetting the credentials to the
RSA II. After a brief bit of searching, I found <a href=
"http://brain4free.org/wiki/doku.php/blog:reset_password_on_a_ibm_rsa_ii"
>a solution</a> suitable for someone like myself, who hasn't got the RSA II
daemon for Linux configured and running. The process can be summarised as:

<ol>
	<li>Download <a href=
"https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/14/Live/i686/Fedora-14-i686-Live-Desktop.iso"
	    >Fedora-14-i686-Live-Desktop.iso</a> — old enough to run the tools.
	<li>Download <a href=
"http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-5081608"
	    >ibm_svc_rsa2_hlp253a_linux_32-64.tgz</a> — the RSA Linux daemon.
	<li>Download <a href=
"ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/systems/support/system_x/ibm_utl_asu-3.60-asut69k.i386.rpm"
	    >ibm_utl_asu-3.60-asut69k.i386.rpm</a> — the IBM settings utility.
	<li>Boot the live Fedora image.
	<li>Install <code>ibmusbasm-1.53-2.rhel5.i686.rpm</code> from the
	    daemon archive.
	<li>Install <code>ibm_utl_asu-3.60-asut69k.i386.rpm</code> and
	    <code>libusb-devel</code>.
	<li>As root, run <code>ibmspdown &amp;&amp; ibmspup</code>.
	<li>Watch syslog until <code>ibmasm</code> notifies that it has loaded.
	<li>As root, run <code>/opt/ibm/toolscenter/asu/asu resetrsa</code>.
</ol>

<p>The credentials were reset, and I was ready to go. After looking up the RSA
II in my DHCP server's lease table, I logged in to the web interface, but the
page consistently stalled while loading. An obstacle, but at least I was now
able to access the controller. Considering that the Fedora live image was still
running, I thought to try the <a href=
"http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-56759"
>Linux release of KPEP30A</a>, and sure enough, it updated the board to version
1.09.

<p>With three firmware updates and all settings reset to their defaults,
hopefully things run a bit more smoothly now. Until then, it's time to enjoy
the local console without even leaving the comfort of my desk for the server
room.
