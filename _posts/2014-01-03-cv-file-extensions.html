<p>Eevee: "In glancing over these résumés, I’ve observed a pattern: I’m far
quicker to judge the file extension than the contents. [...] <i>pdf clearly
generated from LaTeX:</i> Instant boner. Are you sure you’re in comp sci and
not math? Maybe you want a LISP shop. [...] <i>anything that 0-days my
machine:</i> You can have my job."
