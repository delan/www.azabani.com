<p>Using a DMA attack over FireWire, Carsten Maartmann-Moe provides a reliable
means of breaking into running computers, even with full-disk encryption.
Windows XP SP2, Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu 11.04 and onward are all vulnerable,
and one can even use a IEEE 1394 controller over PCMCIA, ExpressCard or
Thunderbolt. Remember: without physical security, you have no security.
