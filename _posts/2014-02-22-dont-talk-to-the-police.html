<p>Every few months, I watch law professor James Duane's captivating <a href=
"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/07/why_you_should.html"
>Schneier-approved</a> lecture on the perils of responding to police officers
when being questioned. While the legal context may not completely adapt to
jurisdictions outside the United States, the general principle remains solid:
even if you say the complete truth, nothing but the truth, don't reveal any
suspicious sentiments, and have your responses recorded, talking to the police
can only do harm â€” never help you.
