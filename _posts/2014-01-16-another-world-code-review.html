<p>When I first played <i>Another World</i>, I was amazed at the visual effects
and quality of the graphics that Ã‰ric Chahi managed to fit on a floppy disk
which ran on an Atari ST. Now I'm even further astounded by the fact that the
game has been ported to twelve platforms over twenty years without a single
change to the game's code, because of a very clever embedded VM. Fabien
Sanglard investigates.
