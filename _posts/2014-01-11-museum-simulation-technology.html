<p>Everyone knows that the perceived size of an object is a function of its
actual size as well as its location relative to you and other objects. What if
you could move objects while maintaining their perceived size, projecting them
as far away as possible without collisions? You could intuitively change the
size of objects, even yourself! <i>The Museum of Simulation Technology</i>
honestly gave me the same feeling as watching <i>Narbacular Drop</i> for the
first time, except on a whole new level. Please take my money.
