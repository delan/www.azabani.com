<p>Imagine that you're on a bicycle, and you've been pushed to aid your start
for a few dozen metres. Imagine that you've continued pedalling, thinking that
you're now moving on your own, but there is in fact no chain on your bicycle.
You've been fruitlessly spinning your legs, deceived by the residual velocity
that is now quickly diminishing. You are in fact me, discovering that prior
knowledge can only get me so far with underdeveloped study skills.

<p>Before this year, my second year of university, I have had great fortune in
performing very well in education, from primary through to tertiary. This was
due to a combination of help from my parents as well as my own individual
learning, especially in areas related to computing. However, this was both a
blessing and a curse. I never learned how to learn new concepts, only build
upon content that I was at least vaguely familiar with.

<p>Even the second semester of my first year was subject to this. Knowing
essentially all of the content of one unit, and a significant portion of the
foundations required for the others meant that there was nothing completely new
to be understood. I fell victim to erroneous assumptions, like the idea that
reading textbooks and attending lectures were unnecessary, which worked in the
past but have recently been beginning to falter.

<p>This year, I can safely say that I can't bring enough prior knowledge or
experience to the table. I simply have insufficient depth to continue avoiding
the actual act of studying. I've just burned through four weeks of contact, but
I feel like I know essentially nothing about the units that I am taking. Waves
of assessments are flowing in as soon as the next week, and I am seriously
distressed about my position.

<p>When I set aside a whole weekend dedicated to studying a unit in every
waking hour I can, I part permanently from those hours having only gained what
feels like an hour or two of work achieved at best. Being unable to learn
efficaciously strikes a dissonant and grating change to my perception of my
mind, which now presents itself as a far duller blade.

<p>Scarcity of time is not my biggest issue, with 14 hours of university, four
tutoring and ten working. Quitting my job so that I can spend another ten hours
a week impaling my head in futility against the challenge of learning won't
help. Learning how to learn is best invoked over the course of a lifetime, but
I will need to figure out how to catch up on years lost very soon, lest my
bicycle shall come to a standstill.
