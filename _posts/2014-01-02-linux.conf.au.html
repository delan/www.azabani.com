title: linux.conf.au 2014

<p><a href="https://lca2014.linux.org.au">linux.conf.au</a> is in Perth this
year, and it's perfect timing for me as I won't have to travel out of the city
for my first attendance. As the conference jumps between universities across
Australia and New Zealand each year, the last time it was held here was eleven
years ago.

<p>While I'll have to betray my soon <i>alma mater</i> and enter the foreign
realm of the University of Western Australia, it'll be interesting to meet some
people from its <a href="https://www.ucc.asn.au/">University Computer Club</a>,
the counterpart of ComSSA, and see how things are done over on the other side.

<p>There are so many great events that it's nearly impossible to list them all
here, and even more difficult to choose what to attend in the sea of overlapping
conference tracks. Everything from Go and Rust to kernel hacking, smoothly
scaling web applications to GPU programming, filesystems, text editors, Arduino
and almost anything else you can imagine will be in one place next week.

<p>There's simply far too much for me to do it any justice, so don't take my
word for it, just go anyway. To conclude with an obligatory plug, there are 9%
of the conference tickets still yet to be sold, so now is the time to <a
href="https://lca2014.linux.org.au/registration/new">register</a>. It's <a
href="https://lca2014.linux.org.au/register/prices">only $99</a> for us
notoriously poor students.
