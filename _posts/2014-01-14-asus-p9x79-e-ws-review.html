<p>Step aside, gaudy ROG rice burners. Okay, perhaps I'm being too harsh, but
this board provides virtually everything I want from a 1P system. Most
impressive is the use of two PLX PEX 8747 lane switches, providing a
configuration of x16/x8/x8/x8/x16/x8/x8 PCIe 3.0 lanes where all slots are
occupied.
