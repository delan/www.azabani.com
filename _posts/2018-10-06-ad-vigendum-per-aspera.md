The last four years have fucked with me in ways out of which I’ve only
really started clawing myself over the last year or so. I went from
feeling like I could do anything and improve the lives of the people
around me, to feeling like an unreliable piece of shit whose only
skills were botching my responsibilities and disappointing the people
I knew. I gave up on learning to play the hand I was dealt, neglected
the people I love, and grew to cope with all of my problems the only
way I knew: by ignoring them. But the scales are finally staring to
tip in my favour, and it’s time for me to end my exile.

## 2016

<!-- ### February 2016 -->

I quit my internship, like the last two, because I refused to continue
taking money when I couldn’t think clearly enough to do even half of
the work I should’ve been doing. Three internships — 2014, 2015, 2016
— and three early resignations. This was a huge blow: my teaching job
was the only one of the four jobs I had ever been hired for that I
could hold down for more than a few months, but I immediately
dismissed it as an outlier and started believing this was the just
deserts for my intrinsic incompetence.

I learned that I have ADHD, a condition whose symptoms would later be
described as comparable to early dementia (Callahan et al. [via
@FioraAeterna][0]), and started treating it with stimulants, which
went a long way towards helping me through my final year.

<!-- ### December 2016 -->

I crossed the finish line without failing a single unit (though a
couple were close). I still lived with my parents, so unbeknownst to
me, my life was about to get way harder, and this gave me a false
sense of confidence in the completeness of stimulant therapy alone.

## 2017

<!-- ### January 2017 -->

I fucked off to Sydney to start my new job, leaving way too many loose
ends untied. I had underdelivered on the handover that I promised the
new ComSSA committee, and to add insult to injury, went unreachable
for months at a time, and would end up waiting a year before making a
serious attempt to deliver the rest.

<!-- ### March 2017 -->

A couple of months in, work sent me to my alma mater to shill our
graduate program, together with the two colleagues that I graduated
with. I procrastinated writing my slide deck until my taxi ride there,
but unsatisfied with the mere punishment of presenting bad slides, my
utterly broken time management delivered me to the venue so late that
my part should’ve started and ended by the time I arrived. My
colleague improvised my part, and I don’t think she ever forgave me
for forcing her to do that. I don’t blame her.

Without the skills I needed to exercise agency over my cursed brain,
my life quickly deteriorated and I floundered at work. I spent what
felt like every waking hour either at work or struggling to get ready
for work or ensuring that I could make it to work on time, but for all
my effort I received a mediocre performance review and no promotion.

<!-- ### December 2017 -->

Mum suggested that we plan my time in Perth when I went home for the
holidays. This was pretty foreign to me — planning wasn’t something I
had ever done of my own volition — but so was the result, which marked
the start of my belated learning of the truth behind the “drugs
<em>and</em> therapy” advice that every Mental Illness 101 includes.

## 2018

<!-- ### June? 2018 -->

One of my closest friends invited me to his wedding. I prepared my
outfit and gift and I was happy with the fruits of my preparation,
but I left some of it to the morning of the day. I rushed to show up
on time but misread my invitation, mistaking the reception place for
the wedding place, and I missed the wedding.

I’ve started getting the hang of my limitations and adapting to them
with appropriate tools. I remind myself to do things with timers,
alarms, or calendar events, depending on how long I’m deferring them
by. I’m learning how to use org-mode and Trello as structured
extensions of my memory, rather than write-only black holes like
Sublime Text buffers. These are just a couple of examples, and ADHD
management is definitely a subject worth exploring further, but that’s
a job for another day.

* * *

Reading [this essay about ADHD][1] by [@gravislizard][2] was a crucial
moment that brought me to tears, and I think it’s just as useful an
introduction to what I grapple with every day. Pretty much all of the
experiences he wrote about resonate with me, but there’s one that I’ll
highlight shortly, because it helps explain [something I wrote a
couple of years ago][3]:

> To all who have sent me a thing and are still waiting for a response
> (be it for a day or for ten months), I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be
> rude.
>
> The short version of my excuse goes like this. Every time I reply to
> a message, I feel like I’m faced with two more to which I haven’t,
> and I feel overwhelmed, so I cope with that feeling by ignoring the
> cause. As the problem grows, I feel more <strong>anxious about the
> thought of saying “sorry for the late response” with a straight
> face, when all this time, I knew how long you’ve been waiting, and
> you know how long I’ve kept you waiting</strong>, so I ignore it. I
> haven’t learned how to break a task into manageable pieces, and if I
> can’t solve a problem thoroughly in one sitting or a few, I ignore
> it.

What might not make sense is why I would see replying to a message as
a difficult task (though I’ve conflated difficult with big there), but
as he explains, it can be really hard for me to follow through and
finish my replies between getting [lost in the woods][4] and straight
up forgetting, but I needed to realise how neglectful it was for me to
concede defeat:

> Suppose I’m at work and I think, “I need to send an email to
> &lt;people&gt; about &lt;issue&gt;.” Before I can do anything, I’m
> already thinking about the issue.
>
> I try to write the email, but as I’m writing it, questions fill my
> head. I try to push them aside and just concentrate on the initial
> task, send a simple email, but the questions keep hounding me. I
> have to stop and get answers to them or I can’t think about the
> email. And if I can’t get answers, I’m stuck. I just can’t proceed.
> <strong>I end up staring at the empty compose window for ten
> minutes, writing the first sentence over and over,</strong> because
> my mind is so far out of the game I can’t even do basic grammar.

> ADHD’s also a motherfucker. get texted at 8AM “wanna hang out
> tonight”, <strong>read it, forget to reply until 3PM.</strong>

If you reach out to me, <strong>you should hear back from me by the
end of the day</strong> (or the next at worst). I’ve made commitments
like this with a few of the people in my life, and those have been
much easier said than done, so how will this be any different?

I’ll try to reply in chunks that mirror my thought processes, rather
than set out to write one perfect message that’s completely devoid of
uncertainty and unknowns. The latter encourages the very kind of
“depth-first search” that will leave me lost in the woods, and it’s
not really how conversations are supposed to work.

I’ll get comfortable with admitting that from time to time I’m too
cooked to respond properly. Even if it means you might need to suspend
your disbelief, because you’ve only sent me a funny video and how hard
can a response to that be? Accepting that some of my 503 errors might
make me look silly is better than working myself up to an extended
panic attack that I’ll cope with by ignoring you for three months.

I’ll remind myself that — like any goal I want to convert to a habit —
some number of failures will be inevitable, and they’re a signal that
I should look for ways to tweak my approach and make it more reliable,
not that my whole effort was pointless and I should put it in the bin.
As obvious as this sounds, it wasn’t obvious to me until a year ago,
before which I believed I couldn’t make or break a habit for longer
than three days.

By the way, there’s just one more thing. I’m transgender, going by
they/them for now (but don’t panic if you drop a he/him here and
there), and I’m pleased to say that I’ve just started HRT.
Conveniently enough <span lang="ckb">دىلان</span> (<span
lang="kmr">dîlan</span>) [isn’t exclusively masculine][5], and [one
source][6] even describes it as a woman’s name, so I’m pretty
comfortable with my name.
