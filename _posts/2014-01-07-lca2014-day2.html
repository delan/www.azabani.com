<p>An excellent start to the second day of LCA 2014 was unexpectedly seeing
the one and only Linus Torvalds seated on the opposite side of the Octagon
Theatre during the keynote. To counter this, while I'm wearing the official
shirt today, I've forgotten my lanyard pass, so I really hope I'm not rejected
from any talks.

<p>Topics on the Linux kernel track included filesystem integrity, advice for
new contributors to the kernel, testing device drivers, further details of
block device replication with MARS, minimising idle power consumption without
fully suspending, and features of the new POWER8 CPU, which includes an
impressive twelve cores and eight hardware threads per core. Linus occasionally
offered his wisdom, concluding to applause, "I don't do storage."

<p>For lunch, we headed into the city for Caf√© Biscotti, apparently the only
coffee shop in Perth that accepts Bitcoin. The very friendly barista said that
there were about ten Bitcoin customers before us in the week since accepting
Bitcoin, and even offered us a free muffin afterwards. In the new Bankwest
building; definitely would recommend.

<p>Briefly switching among the Astronomy and Open Programming miniconf tracks
yielded some insights into high-performance computing and large-scale data
processing with the Square Kilometre Array, plus some lightning talks including
a very interesting one about IPython Notebook, positioned as a web-based
alternative to Mathematica.

<p>Moving back to the kernel miniconf, Linus and three other core developers
gave an open-ended panel discussion, taking intriguing questions like "What
were your most tricky bugs to fix?" as well as some obvious questions such
as "In this post-Snowden world, do you see more companies switching to Linux?"

<p>Linus' encouraging response? "I'm a cynic and a pessimist, so I think
nothing will change."

<p>Out on the grass as a cool sunset loomed, the key signing BoF session was
surprisingly stringent. All equipped with photo identification, we formed a
line and verified each other, then we checked for matching fingerprints on the
printed key list and each key owner's <code>gpg --fingerprint</code> output.
I've already received one signature, which is a great start.

<p>Half price waffles make for a guilty but fulfilling dinner. I have great
expectations for many sessions tomorrow including a history of Linux
filesystems, reverse engineering firmware drivers, and a massive live upgrade
jumping ten years from Red Hat to Debian across thousands of servers. Exciting
stuff.
