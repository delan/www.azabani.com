title: Renaming Active Directory domains

<p>Last night I tried to implement DNSSEC on <code>azabani.com</code> without
any prior knowledge. That went badly, and I lost mail for at least a few hours.
I've separated my experimental Active Directory domain off onto <code
>azabani.org</code>, where I can safely try DNSSEC again without losing mail,
but the migration process wasn't straightforward.

<p>In the past, to rename the AD domain <code>home.azabani.com</code> to <code
>azabani.com</code>, I simply set up the domain controller from scratch, then
reimaged clients. However, this requires a lot of unnecessary time, as well as
much manual correction of user profile and registry permissions.

<p>To summarise, <a
href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738208%28v=ws.10%29.aspx"
>renaming an AD domain</a> is as follows:

<ol>
	<li>Create a new forward lookup DNS zone for the new root domain name.
	<li><pre>rendom /list</pre>
	<li>Edit <code>Domainlist.xml</code> to use the new root domain name.
	<li>
<pre>
rendom /showforest
rendom /upload
rendom /prepare
rendom /execute
</pre>
	<li>Reboot the domain controller.
	<li>
<pre>
gpfixup /olddns:azabani.com /newdns:azabani.org
rendom /clean
rendom /end
</pre>
</ol>

<p>However, that doesn't actually rename the domain contoller's FQDN itself.
While Microsoft says that doing so is optional, it seems like a good idea to do
anyway, as <code>azabani.com</code> is now being used elsewhere, and the domain
controller will otherwise not resolve externally.

<p>Again to summarise what <a
href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc816601%28v=ws.10%29.aspx"
>Microsoft has to say</a> about this:

<ol>
	<li>
<pre>
netdom computername OLDFQDN /add:NEWFQDN
netdom computername OLDFQDN /makeprimary:NEWFQDN
</pre>
	<li>Reboot the domain controller.
	<li>
<pre>
netdom computername NEWFQDN /remove:OLDFQDN
</pre>
</ol>

<p>That's not all, in fact. If you're like me and use the domain controller as
a DHCP server, it will continue to distribute the old root FQDN as the default
DNS search suffix. To correct this in the DHCP snap-in, for each scope's
options, change <code>015 DNS Domain Name</code> as necessary.

<p>I've omitted a few steps that are required for those with multiple domain
controllers, those who are renaming the NetBIOS domain name, and/or those who
are renaming the leaf computer name of the domain controller, so follow the
links above if you have a more complex migration situation, as this'll probably
be incomplete.

<p>Strangely enough, without rebooting any clients, they all immediately
became a member of the "new" domain (technically the same AD domain, with a
new root FQDN), and their fully qualified computer names updated as well.
I'll consider myself impressed.
