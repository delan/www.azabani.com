title: make error 253 when installing any Ruby gems on Windows

<p>Recently I've been unable to install any gems that require native extensions.
This included both rdiscount and wdm, the latter of which I need to run <code
>jekyll serve -w</code> and automatically rebuild sites as needed on Windows.
The cause of the problem turned out to make no sense.

<pre>
Active code page: 65001
generating rdiscount-x64-mingw32.def
make: *** [rdiscount-x64-mingw32.def] Error 253
</pre>

<p>Perhaps it was the code page? To force the use of UTF-8 everywhere, mainly
so that Liquid doesn't break on Unicode characters when running Jekyll, I had
set up <code>cmd.exe</code> to <code>chcp 65001</code> whenever opened by
creating the registry key:

<pre>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun REG_EXPAND_SZ
</pre>

<p>Disabled that, tried again, no change, so I put it back. Stuck for an hour
or two, I came back and tried running <code>make</code> manually on the gem
directory, and lo and behold, a window exclaimed that <code>sh.exe has stopped
working</code>.

<pre>
Problem signature:
  Problem Event Name:	APPCRASH
  Application Name:	sh.exe
  Fault Module Name:	KERNELBASE.dll
  Exception Code:	c00000fd
</pre>

<p>Confirming this, running the DevKit's <code>sh</code> crashes, while <code
>bash</code> does not. I then took the opportunity to upgrade from Ruby 1.9.3
to 2.0.0, but sadly nothing changed still.

<p>After some further investigation, it turns out that <code>sh</code> has a
stack overflow when being run through <a href="https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon"
>ansicon</a>, a wrapper that processes ANSI escape sequences output from a
Win32 console. I had Console2 configured to run <code>cmd.exe</code> through
it, so that all programs were essentially wrapped, and any sequences output by
them would work as expected.

<p>Simple solution: when running <code>gem</code>, open <code>cmd.exe</code>
directly. It's not like <code>gem</code> has coloured output or anything, so
you're not missing out.
