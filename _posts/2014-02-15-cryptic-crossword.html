<p>Brian Raiter leads by example in demonstrating that reverse engineering an
obscure file format with undocumented encryption can be distilled down to a
rigorous application of the scientific method, automation taken to an extreme
for gathering large sets of sample data, and creating clever ways to visualise
patterns in the data. I'm most impressed by Raiter's ability to come back to
the project years later and document it with the astounding level of detail
that he has. It's truly a thrilling ride to read.
