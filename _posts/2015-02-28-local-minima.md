Sixteen weeks have elapsed since I [last wrote][last] about
depression. Since then I have repeatedly slipped into deeper local
minima, first five weeks ago, then a fortnight ago, making previously
awful states seem like manageable annoyances in hindsight. The
following further documents my decline, as I belatedly decide to ask
for help.

## Analysis

One theme of this discussion is depression's ability
to create absurd juxtapositions.

How can the fall be so terrible,
yet to allow it to gain momentum and devour its host
is occasionally and frighteningly more alluring
than fighting against it?

How can it induce an intense hopelessness which does not relent
when faced with the knowledge that at least some amount of the
alarm is undue?

How can it completely quench pleasure from
that which one knows is enjoyable?

How can it cause such wretched pain,
yet neuter one's ability to cry?

How can it be imagined as an impending beast,
yet also a complete void?

## Paralysis

Many of my friends gave me valid advice, and for that I am grateful.
They urged me to improve my sleep, diet, and exercise, while seeking
professional help. These may seem obvious, but it was necessary to
hear them from external observers.

I never took their advice because I remain overwhelmed by a constant,
continuously intensifying fatigue, both physically and mentally, far
eclipsing my capacity to thwart this vicious feedback loop. This is
most regrettable, as if only I had been a little stronger, a little
earlier, those measures could have spared me from my current state.

## Perspective

Twice I have opened myself to a friend who I hadn't regularly seen in
several months. This is important because he was thus impartial to my
daily responsibilities and interactions with others. Both times I was
afraid of how my disclosures would affect his opinion of me however,
so I attenuated the true extent of my thoughts and feelings.

Perhaps due to that, at times I felt frustrated by how we weren't
really on the same page. He too had dealt with periods of low energy,
productivity, and ambition, but perhaps for different reasons, and
he mitigated them differently because of it. I was unsure if I was
clear about the extent of my underlying depression, as opposed to
simply the secondary symptoms. On the other hand, perhaps it was
necessary perspective which I had lacked.

Having someone to whom I could voice my thoughts was invaluable, but
I am left with more pressing questions than I had beforehand. With
experience doing this to another person in the past, I constantly
grow fearful of destroying a second friendship by overusing him as a
sounding board, lest I am seen as a child wanting a parental figure.

## Anhedonia

While I previously only lacked the motivation to engage in enjoyable
activities, I'm now unable to feel pleasure while doing them, even
while I'm adamant that they are enjoyable on a higher layer of
thought. Consider the concert which I went to on Monday, or ice
skating with friends last night. I knew they were great, but I didn't
feel that way.

The absence of happiness is a far more insidious adversary than the
overt but simplistic feeling of misery. I wish I had known this in
advance, because the former builds unseen over time, culminating in
an abject emptiness once noticed.

## Solitude

I've always been a lonely person. I have no siblings, I've never had
a serious relationship, and I'm not as close with my friends as I'd
like to be. Having nobody to provide emotional and physical affection
is normally a bearable flaw, but it feeds on depression to yield a
universal loneliness that can only superficially be restrained by
being around friends.

## Anxiety

Panic attacks were a new and very unpleasant experience for me a few
months ago. Shortness of breath, xerostomia, intestinal discomfort,
temporary tachycardia, and uncontrollable shaking were all phenomena
which I became acutely familiar with.

Now they're a regular occurrence, while just as unpleasant. They are
easily caused by anything from important meetings or the prospect of
meeting new people, to predicting how depression will affect how I
perform academically in the year to come. Mundane factors, such as
speaking to others in person, negatively modulate them further.

The release of the list of final year software engineering projects
last week was followed by the most intense such attack I've had yet,
as I realised that without serious help, I'm in no state to
productively complete a project, and I would let my group down
significantly.

## Withdrawal

I would argue that my pool of responsibilities is trivial for any
healthy and competent person in my position. For instance, my job
purely consists of training for now, essentially by reading relevant
technical books and trying my hand at penetration testing.

Nobody really depends on me — not even myself — and yet I feel
grossly inadequate and poorly equipped to complete my small handful
of tasks.

My level of productivity was dismal, so rather than mislead those
whom I answer to, I suspended all of my roles earlier this week, both
paid and unpaid.

## Ideation

'Why haven't you killed yourself?'

He asked me this bluntly but without incitement, as he genuinely
wanted to know. I too genuinely wanted to know. After all, while
thoughts of suicide were once a small part of the back of my mind,
they have grown to dominate not only every waking moment, but also
some dreaming moments.

Having given the question what seemed like a minute of thought, I
settled for lethargy as my reason. 'It requires too much effort. I
just haven't gotten around to it yet.'

While I don't think that's the only reason, it has worryingly become
the dominant one. Thus I remain alive, with no will to live, for the
near future.

## Action

The new university semester starts on Monday, timing which makes this
a very awkward balancing act. The final year group project is what
I'm most concerned about by far. If I decide to delay it and needn't,
I'll delay my graduation by a whole year. If I decide to persist
without the support of urgent treatment, I will harm my group's
performance.

I'm working with another friend to undergo triage on Monday, with a
following appointment as soon as possible. Without his help, I will
probably never climb out of this deep hole. I hope that there exists
appropriate medication which can give me some initial momentum
reasonably quickly, so that I needn't sink into permanent withdrawal.
