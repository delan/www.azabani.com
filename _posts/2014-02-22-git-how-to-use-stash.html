<p>A quick introduction to a very useful feature of Git that I wasn't aware of.
The stash is essentially a flexible stack that allows you to stow away changes
to your working directory while you work on another issue with a clean
repository. The flexibility lies in that you may retrieve and apply a stashed
change that isn't necessarily at the top of the stack.
