<p>My friend and fellow Curtin computing student doesn't pull any punches when
it comes to the multiple, systematic and serious failures and poor decisions
made by the management of the university only legally known as the Curtin
University of Technology. What is essentially the forced termination of one of
our best lecturers was simply the last straw, and until I can find the
motivation to write more elaborately about what I've seen in my year here, Kye
has expressed my thoughts pretty faithfully.
