title: More IRCd-Hybrid shenanigans

<p>I thought I had <a href="/2014/01/31/using-ipv6-with-ircd-hybrid.html"
>fixed</a> the IPv6 connectivity issues on ComSSA's IRC server, as I was
happily connected from a local shell on the server. Yesterday, when trying to
connect from a Linux box at home, I realised that connections from external
addresses were timing out â€” even though <code>netstat</code> showed Hybrid was
listening properly on both addresses! I suppose it was time to dig a little
deeper. What could go wrong?

<p>It turned out, to my surprise, that we were running Hybrid 7.2.2, the same
version provided by Debian Wheezy at the moment. The latest upstream version as
of today is 8.1.13, so I took the route of trying to compile that to see if the
IPv6 problems were addressed in the many versions between.

<p>After wrangling around a bit with a broken installation that had an
inconsistent directory layout, reading INSTALL a second time, and realising
that you must set a specific prefix for autoconf that isn't the default, I got
it working. Hybrid 8 is, as you would expect, a major change from version 7,
and sadly that meant I had to rewrite the <a href=
"https://github.com/ComSSA/servers/blob/53ec44e3e0c3323c0fac21818cfbebb4deb1498c/ling/overlay/usr/local/ircd/etc/ircd.conf"
>configuration file</a> from scratch, with a bit of hunting to find the new
equivalents of changed directives.

<pre>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ircd
make -j4
make install
chown -Rv irc:irc /usr/local/ircd/etc /usr/local/ircd/var</pre>

<p>I was finally, for the first time, able to connect from home over both IPv4
and IPv6. With that preliminary testing on an alternate port range done,
ensuring that the server linking worked, and that the new IRCd did indeed fix
the problem, I swapped it in.

<p>This time, I was as careful as I could to minimise downtime with consecutive
executions of the old and new init scripts. I had learned the hard way only a
day earlier that stopping the server, frantically messing with configuration
files, then starting a new daemon is a bad idea, and definitely annoys users.

<pre>
nano /usr/local/ircd/etc/ircd.conf # change listening ports from 1666x to 666x
/etc/init.d/ircd-hybrid stop &amp;&amp; ./ircd reload
</pre>

<p>Immediately afterwards, I had to leave for several hours to help with
renovations. Then I came back at the end of the day, feeling completely
deflated upon seeing that the same symptoms had resurfaced. I tried adding
another, higher range of ports to concurrently listen on, and they, like the
testing port range, worked. The lower, normal IRC ports continued to time out
external connections over IPv6.

<pre>
$ for i in 146.185.129.226 2001:470:7c85::1; do for j in 36669 6669; do
> nc -vvz $i $j; done; done # note: using netcat-openbsd not netcat-traditional
Connection to 146.185.129.226 36669 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 146.185.129.226 6669 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
Connection to 2001:470:7c85::1 36669 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
nc: connect to 2001:470:7c85::1 port 6669 (tcp) failed: Connection timed out
</pre>

<p>That had me stumped. Surely Hurricane Electric wouldn't resort to the
practice of blocking common ports of "vulnerable" services like SMTP and IRC? I
avoided that troubling idea and looked for other options. A few hours later,
I couldn't let go of the thought that the tunnel was indeed the point of
failure. If a service is shown as listening on <code>netstat</code>, then
surely <code>netcat</code> would almost always work?

<p>At the lowest point in my essentially fruitless troubleshooting efforts, I
actually pulled up a terminal to watch <code>strace</code> output of the
running daemon, and noticed that no connection was being seen on the side of
the IRC server, when a normal IRC port over IPv6 was attempted. One thing I did
notice is that the latest version of Hybrid still has the bug where listening
on both wildcard addresses (<code>0.0.0.0</code> and <code>::</code>) will have
the second one fail with <code>EADDRINUSE</code>. I suppose I could dig into
the source, and report a bug if necessary.

<p>Searching for answers, I found some <a href=
"https://www.tunnelbroker.net/forums/index.php?topic=2395.0">confused</a> and
perhaps <a href="https://www.tunnelbroker.net/forums/index.php?topic=2205.0"
>irate</a> users, which led me to an <a href=
"https://ipv6.he.net/certification/faq.php">official source</a> on the matter,
confirming my suspicions. Due to past abuse and attacks, tunnels need to be on
an IPv6 Sage certified Tunnelbroker account to have common IRC ports unblocked.
Fancy terminology aside, this essentially means filling out a few dozen
technical quiz questions about IPv6 provided by Hurricane Electric in what I'd
imagine is an advocacy effort to increase awareness of the protocol among
technical users.

<p>Already having completed the IPv6 Sage process on my personal account, doing
so again was a breeze. Sadly I rushed into destroying and creating a new
tunnel, assuming it was necessary, before realising that there is an explicit
opt-in required in the advanced tunnel configuration. As such, the address of
<code>ling.comssa.org.au</code> has changed from <code>2001:470:7c85::1</code>
to <code>2001:470:78b9::1</code>.

<p>Full of regret at wasting so many hours compiling and configuring Hybrid 8,
I yielded and swapped the server back to its <a href=
"/2014/01/31/using-ipv6-with-ircd-hybrid.html">initial configuration</a> and
into the warm, comforting realm of the official Debian package. My sole
consolation is in the fact that ComSSA's IRC server is now truly dual stack.

<p>While I've definitely learned a lot over the last two days, especially in
the field of setting up and running Hybrid, the biggest lessons here are
actually to stop rushing, think about all of the components that could possibly
be involved, and avoid tying yourself so tightly to one "solution" that you
spend days solving a problem that should take hours at most.
