<p>Tired of the sluggishness of Windows on my laptop and interested in
experimenting with a Unix-like that I haven't tried before, I gave
OpenBSD a second shot after a <a
href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.os.openbsd.misc/193097">brief stint</a>
on my netbook a couple of years back. Coming from exclusively using Gentoo,
this seemed like a natural choice due to its minimalism and the shared roots
between ports and portage. Reading <a
href="https://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01">Matthew D.
Fuller's comparison</a> of BSD and Linux inspired me to venture beyond the
familiar walls of the Linux world.

<p>It would be prudent to start with a hint of background. I first discovered
Linux via a cover disc on the APC magazine which included a live image for
Mandriva Linux 2006.0. Until then, I had been using Windows XP, Windows 98
and Windows 95 in reverse order. While I dabbled with it, the concept of
actually installing something that wasn't Windows on my computer never crossed
my mind.

<p>In 2009, I installed Ubuntu 9.04 cold turkey and continued using it for
nearly two years, at which point I distro-hopped to Debian. For the entirety
of 2012, I used Gentoo and I even had a small distcc cluster, but I eventually
became annoyed at the poor quality of Linux userland software. From then until
now, I had returned to Windows 7 with a sometimes painful drop of Cygwin where
I needed a Unixish environment.

<h2>Creating an installation medium</h2>

<p>I'm currently using an <a
href="http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/U31SD/">Asus U31SD</a> which has
no optical disc drive, calling for the use of a USB flash drive. I wanted to
partition my large flash drive such that I could use it simultaneously as
installation media and a backup destination. This was not trivial to configure
in a way compatible with Windows.

<p>Windows makes an arbitrary, silly distinction whereby it tries very hard to
avoid partitioning 'removable disks', a category which includes USB flash
drives, but not USB portable hard drives. Using diskmgmt.msc, diskpart or any
stock GUI tool will create a partition table if the disk has no recognisable
volume or partition table, but will only allow one partition to be created.
Behold the idiocy:

<pre>
DISKPART> clean

DiskPart succeeded in cleaning the disk.

DISKPART> convert mbr

DiskPart successfully converted the selected disk to MBR format.

DISKPART> create partition primary size=4096

DiskPart succeeded in creating the specified partition.

DISKPART> create partition primary size=4096

No usable free extent could be found. It may be that there is insufficient
free space to create a partition at the specified size and offset. Specify
different size and offset values or don't specify either to create the
maximum sized partition. It may be that the disk is partitioned using the MBR disk
partitioning format and the disk contains either 4 primary partitions, (no
more partitions may be created), or 3 primary partitions and one extended
partition, (only logical drives may be created).

DISKPART> clean

DiskPart succeeded in cleaning the disk.

DISKPART> convert gpt

DiskPart successfully converted the selected disk to GPT format.

DISKPART> create partition primary size=4096

DiskPart succeeded in creating the specified partition.

DISKPART> create partition primary size=4096

Virtual Disk Service error:
The operation is not supported on a non-empty removable disk.
</pre>

<p>If the disk has a direct volume with no partition table, Windows will roll
with that and pretend that there is one partition. If multiple partitions are
created on a disk elsewhere, its behaviour on Windows appears to be
unpredictable, but it looks like a drive letter can be assigned to the first
partition entry in the MBR, depending on the phase of the moon.

<p>There is allegedly a 'removable media bit' in some drive controllers which
can be flipped by a tool for Lexar drives called BootIt. Sadly it appeared to
have no effect on my 64 GB Corsair drive. I tried creating many partition
configurations using OpenBSD's own fdisk in a virtual machine, as well as GNU
fdisk and parted on Debian. None of them played nicely with Windows. All I
wanted was an NTFS or FAT32 partition plus a BSD disklabel.

<p>What did work was dumping the contents of <code>install55.fs</code> or
<code>miniroot55.fs</code> onto the entire drive, then adding another partition
on entry 0 from there. These files contain not only a BSD disklabel with one
root FFS, but ostensibly also an MBR surrounding that.

<pre>

<p>It's perhaps here that I should mention that I found OpenBSD's distinction
between block devices (for disks, partitions and slices) and their
corresponding raw character device files quite bizarre. I suppose I just need
to remember to prepend <code>r</code> to any administrative task pertaining to
partitioning or filesystem creation.

<h2>The installation process proper</h2>

<p>This was actually relatively straightforward, save for the wireless NIC
<code>iwn0</code> not working until firmware files are automatically downloaded
after installation. Using the wired <code>alc0</code> gigabit Ethernet
interface temporarily did the trick, but networking was not even necessary at
this stage, given that I had used the full <code>install55.fs</code> image.

<pre>
iwn0: error, 2, could not read firmware iwn-6030
iwn0: could not read firmware
iwn0: no link ............. sleeping
</pre>

<p>First boot was problematic, as the kernel hung on something ACPI:

<pre>
...
cpu3: smt 1, core 1, package 0
ioapic0 at mainbus0: apid 2 pa 0xfec00000, version 20, 24 pins
acpiec0 at acpi0
acpihpet0 at acpi0: 14318179 Hz
acpimcfg0 at acpi0 addr 0xe0000000, bus 0-63
</pre>

<p>A quick and dirty solution I'm using right now is to disable it:

<pre>
boot> -c
UKC> disable acpi
352 acpi0 disabled
UKC> quit
</pre>

<p>At this point I had to start over because I foolishly elected to start
<code>xdm(1)</code> on boot, leaving me unable to use the keyboard or mouse.
Choosing the right option, I am now greeted with an odd monospaced serif
console. I then disabled ACPI permanently:

<pre>
# cp /bsd{,.old}
# echo quit | config -efu /bsd
</pre>

<p>I missed the automatic firmware installation on first boot, so I had to
invoke the process manually:

<pre>
# echo dhcp > /etc/hostname.alc0
# . /etc/netstart alc0
# fw_update
</pre>

<p>Configuring a connection to my wireless network revealed the elegant nature
of <code>hostname.if(5)</code>, which strongly reminded me of the file format
used with <code>iptables-{save,restore}(8)</code>. It looks like connecting to
Curtin University's network might need <code>wpa_supplicant(8)</code>, however.

<pre>
# echo 'nwid deLAN\nwpakey REDACTED\ndhcp\nrtsol' > /etc/hostname.iwn0
# . /etc/netstart iwn0
</pre>

<p>Some <code>sysctl</code> values prevent global IPv6 address configuration
from working automatically, but after my surprise upon seeing the default
values, they were quickly fixed:

<pre>
# ifconfig iwn0 | grep inet6
        inet6 fe80::b6b6:76ff:fe1e:7bfc%iwn0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1
# rtsol iwn0
rtsol: kernel is configured not to accept RAs
rtsol: kernel is configured not to accept redirects
# sed -E 's/^#(net.inet6.(icmp6.rediraccept|ip6.accept_rtadv)=)/\1/' /etc/sysctl.conf > /etc/sysctl.conf.
# mv /etc/sysctl.conf{.,}
# sysctl net.inet6.icmp6.rediraccept=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv=1
# rtsol iwn0
# ifconfig iwn0 | grep inet6
        inet6 fe80::b6b6:76ff:fe1e:7bfc%iwn0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1
        inet6 2001:44b8:6116:1c00:b6b6:76ff:fe1e:7bfc prefixlen 64 autoconf pltime 3593 vltime 7194
        inet6 2001:44b8:6116:1c00:4487:8545:2941:c33c prefixlen 64 autoconf autoconfprivacy pltime 3593
vltime 7194
</pre>

<h2>Getting X11 working</h2>

<p>Upon trying to run <code>Xorg -configure</code>, it turns out that the
problems I had been having with X11 seem to stem from the <code>pms</code>
driver which is used for the Synaptics touchpad. For now, I'll simply disable
the driver and use an external USB mouse as a pointing device.

<pre>
boot> -c
UKC> disable pms
259 pms* disabled
UKC> quit
# echo quit | config -efu /bsd
</pre>

<h2>Finishing user configuration</h2>

<p>All that's left is to download my dotfiles and install some packages.

<pre>
# sed -E 's/^# (%wheel.+\) SETENV.+)/\1/' /etc/sudoers > /etc/sudoers.
# mv /etc/sudoers{.,}
# chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
$ export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.ii.net/pub/OpenBSD/5.5/packages/amd64/
$ sudo pkg_add -v zsh vim curl git irssi gnupg ...
$ git clone --bare https://github.com/delan/config .git
$ sed -E 's/(bare = )true/\1false/' .git/config > .git/config.
$ mv .git/config{.,}
$ git checkout HEAD
$ chsh -s zsh
$ exec zsh
neptune%
</pre>

<h2>Miscellaneous thoughts</h2>

<p>I very much appreciated the clean separation between the base system, the
packages and the ports tree, and grew to rely on having an eloquent manual page
for every command, driver and configuration file in the base system.

<p>I don't know how I have managed to achieve this, but I can use vim key
bindings in GUI applications, including those that use GTK+. Perhaps it is
influenced by running <code>bindkey -v</code> in my <code>.zshrc</code>.

<p><a href="http://openports.se/">OpenPorts.se</a> was very useful for when I
couldn't recall the exact name of a package I was looking for. In the long run
however, it was much better to fetch and configure the ports tree locally as
recommended. This also buys one the ability to cleanly configure and compile
software from source, which is especially useful for <code>dwm</code>, for
example.

<p>Using <code>pkg_info -t</code> is a useful way of finding packages that one
has explicitly installed so far:

<pre>
neptune% pkg_info -t         
ImageMagick-6.7.7.7p6 image processing tools
chromium-32.0.1700.102-proprietary Chromium browser
dwm-6.0             dynamic window manager
git-1.8.5.3         GIT - Tree History Storage Tool
gnupg-2.0.22p0      gnu privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
irssi-0.8.15p5      modular IRC client with many features (ipv6,socks,proxy)
iwn-firmware-5.10p0 firmware binary images for iwn(4) driver
p7zip-9.20.1p0      file archiver with high compression ratio
povray-3.6.1p5      3D image rendering package
scrot-0.8p3         commandline screen capture util
texlive_texmf-full-2013 texlive texmf for extra macros
uvideo-firmware-1.2p1 firmware binary images for uvideo(4) driver
vim-7.4.135p0-no_x11 vi clone, many additional features
zip-3.0             create/update ZIP files compatible with PKZip(tm)
zsh-5.0.2           Z shell, Bourne shell-compatible
</pre>

<p>In broad strokes, the tasks I have yet to complete are:

<ul>
	<li>Find out why ACPI causes the kernel to hang, and fix that;
	<li>Find out why <code>pms(4)</code> with my touchpad breaks X11;
	<li>Create ports for software I miss such as the Proggy fonts; and
	<li>Create ports for software that I've written, after cleaning up the code.
</ul>
