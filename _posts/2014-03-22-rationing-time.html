<p>I'm not dead yet. I've recently started working at <a
href="http://www.aspermont.com/">Aspermont Limited</a>, supporting and
maintaining their internal web applications while also helping with gradual
migrations to ASP.NET. With ten hours a week there, four tutoring <i>Software
Engineering 110</i>, and fourteen contact hours of full time study,
unfortunately I now have much less spare time than I have been accustomed to.

<p>Many of my friends and family have warned me against taking up this much
responsibility and load so suddenly, because I would risk burning out during
the semester. This isn't aided by the fact that the units I'm now taking seem
to require a significant step up in workload, beyond having three assignments
and an unwieldy group project.

<p>However, 28 hours a week of scheduled obligations isn't by any means
extreme; it isn't even what one would typically consider "full time
employment". I'm looking into methods like timeboxing and the Pomodoro
technique to hone my focus as the number of tasks I need to deal with grows
beyond that which can be handled in an ad-hoc manner. Until then, my
monotonically increasing personal todo list will have to take a distant back
seat.

<p>So far they've proved quite helpful, but other issues have arisen. How do I
stay productive for more than a few timeboxes every day? How can I optimise my
workflow and task prioritisation such that I can achieve maximum efficiency? As
someone who has never dedicated much thought to managing time, these questions
and more are still unanswered for me, and how well I will cope with the next
three months remains to be seen.
