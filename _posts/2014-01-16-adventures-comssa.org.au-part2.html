<p>In another daily episode of configuring ComSSA's new website and Internet
services, here's what I've been up to. The DigitalOcean server has been set up,
users are logged in smoothly, the wiki and imageboard are installed and the
website is ready to run. I should get some sleep now before I become fully
nocturnal.

<p>Hosting the website on GitHub Pages is probably easier and more reliable
than doing so on the new server, especially because committee members can
update it by simply committing and pushing to a Git repository. To do this, I
needed to create a GitHub organisation account, but someone had taken the
username "comssa". Thankfully, GitHub's policy is to release usernames upon
request if there are no commits, repositories or other activity. A brief email
to their support team and the issue was sorted in a few hours.

<p>I've rewritten the shell script used to configure the server. Alas, it's
still a collection of shell scripts, but it's been refactored heavily. The
majority of the configuration is achieved with an overlay directory, which
contains a FHS-like hierarchy of files to be overwritten in the root file
system. As some added bonuses, I've set a hard nproc ulimit to prevent
forkbombs taking down the server, and created a pretty login banner.

<p>The old internal wiki used MediaWiki, which is insanely overkill, so I've
installed DokuWiki instead, which uses a lightweight flat-file storage backend.
While there aren't quite so many pages that manual migration would be unwieldy,
I tried looking for migration scripts in the hope that they'd preserve users
and revision histories. Sadly, neither <a
href="http://www.staerk.de/thorsten/Software/Mediasyntax">Mediasyntax</a> nor <a
href="https://github.com/tetsuo13/MediaWiki-to-DokuWiki-Importer"
>MediaWiki2DokuWiki</a> support any more than migrating page and media content.

<p>ComSSA used to have a traditional web forum, which has also fallen into
relative disuse over the years. We agreed that a more casual imageboard format
resembling 2ch would be better going forward. The package of choice was <a
href="http://kusabax.cultnet.net/">Kusaba X</a>, but to my great frustration,
I spent several hours failing to install it with no error messages of any sort.
I eventually discovered that the sqlite backend support appears to be broken,
as when using MySQL, it works perfectly. That'll teach me for trying to
prematurely optimise RAM usage!

<p>Now I can safely say that the infrastructure is complete. The website, wiki
and imageboard are all ready to accept content, which I'll start working on
tomorrow, and we can start the slow march towards an uptime record moving ever
forward. Who am I kidding? I'll probably break something pretty soon.
