<p>Often loved by those with an appreciation for <span class="tex">T<sub>e</sub
>X</span>, other times reviled by those who think it's a flawed product of
inertia: I'm in the former camp, but it was difficult to get a conversion that
rendered better than terribly on web pages.

<p>The sans-serif family is easy to get right, but the serif is a whole world of
trouble, perhaps because of a lack of adequate hinting for low-density screens.
Combined with being a didone, its hairline horizontals and serifs cause trouble
outside of print.

<p>Knuth's original Computer Modern was not available in any embeddable web font
format (OpenType, TrueType, WOFF, Embedded OpenType or SVG) so we'll have to use
a conversion. A quick overview of the conversion hierarchy:

<ul>
	<li><i><a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cm">Computer Modern</a></i> —
	    the original METAFONT source version by Donald E. Knuth
	<ul>
	<li><i><a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cm-unicode">Computer Modern
	    Unicode</a></i> — OpenType by Andrey Panov and Nikola
	    Lečić
	<ul>
	<li><i><a href="http://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/"
	    >cm-web-fonts</a></i> — TrueType, WOFF, SVG and EOT by an anonymous
	    maintainer
	</ul>
	<li><i><a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/lm">Latin Modern</a></i> —
	    OpenType by Bogusław Jackowski and Janusz Marian Nowacki
	<li><i><a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bakoma-fonts">BaKoMa fonts</a
	    ></i> — OpenType and TrueType by Basil K. Malyshev
	</ul>
</ul>
