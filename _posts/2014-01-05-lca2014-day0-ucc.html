<p>After avoiding a long queue tomorrow by registering early, I decided to use
a bit of spare time taking a peek at how our sibling rivals at the University
Computer Club are going. Everywhere I looked there was an impressive piece of
history, and this is but a small selection.

<p>UCC does offer attendees free shell and email accounts for the month, but I
might just keep them and become a member if registrations are open during the
conference. It'll be a good chance to further explore the hardware that was
long forgotten by most others, and is now in the hands of a club who's turning
40 this year.
