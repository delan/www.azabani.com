<p>This was originally going to be a quick guide to Windows Deployment Services
with Windows Server 2012. Using it to install Windows Vista and newer is
trivial though. However, upon finding a laptop that needed Windows XP and could
only externally boot via PXE, things changed a little.

<p>It's obligatory for me to remind you that Windows XP will finally die in just
over three months' time, so you shouldn't use it unless absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless it's not completely terrible; it even has IPv6 up its sleeve!

<p>I have a Toshiba Tecra M2 with a faulty optical drive. To make things worse,
it's too old to support USB boot. To really rub in the salt, it supports SD card
boot, but only via floppy emulation of a file you place in the FAT root named
<code>$TOSFD00.VFD</code>. I have no idea what their engineers were thinking.

<p>While from Vista onwards it's simply a case of having WDS and dropping in the
WIM file, installing Windows XP is full of pitfalls that took me a great deal of
poring over the Microsoft Knowledge Base and a variety of forums to decipher.
Hopefully this will help someone avoid the same... adventure, to put it nicely.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
	<li><i>Windows Server 2012</i> as the WDS and DHCP server — this can be
	    installed in a virtual machine if desired, and an older version is
	    likely to be usable in much the same way
	<li><i>VMware Workstation</i>, <i>Oracle VM VirtualBox</i> or <i
	    >Microsoft Virtual PC</i> to generate an installation of Windows XP
	    — if you wish to use VirtualBox, make sure the <a
	    href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Extension Pack</a>
	    is installed or PXE booting WDS images will fail
	<li><i>Windows 7 x86</i> media for its <code>boot.wim</code> — this
	    serves the dual role of being the installer for the completed XP
	    image as well as being used to capture the model XP installation
	<li><i>Windows XP Professional</i> media — beware though, unlike newer
	    versions of Windows, there are different media for OEM, Retail and
	    Volume Licensing keys, and each are incompatible with one another
</ul>
