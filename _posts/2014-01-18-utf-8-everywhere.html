<p>A comprehensive rundown of Unicode encodings, why UTF-16 is the worst of all
worlds, and why Windows and Java got it wrong by being too early in the game â€”
before Unicode 2.0, where UCS-2 became UTF-16 and no longer an encoding with
fixed-size code units. The manifesto also effectively attacks the notion that
UTF-16 is more efficient for CJK text, by virtue of compression beating both.
