<p>“A few months ago I saw a blog post touting fancy new SSE3 functions for
implementing vector floor, ceil, and round functions. There was the inevitable
proud proclaiming of impressive performance and correctness. However the ceil
function gave the wrong answer for many numbers it was supposed to handle,
including odd-ball numbers like ‘one’.” — Bruce Dawson
