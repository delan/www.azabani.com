<p>While most mSATA SSDs were either OEM only, far slower than their 2.5"
counterparts, too expensive per gigabyte and/or lacking in capacity, Samsung's
new mSATA variant of their 840 EVO drives solve all four, available to
retailers at up to 1 TB for under $1/GB, pushing at least 540/410 MB/s. My body
is so ready right now.
