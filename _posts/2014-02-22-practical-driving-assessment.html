<p>I'm pleased to say that I've passed my driving test with only a mere three
points lost, leaving me with at least 30 months remaining in the meandering
process known to Western Australians as the "Graduated Driver Training and
Licensing" system. In just under six months' time, I'll be able to undertake a
largely irrelevant and unrealistic computerised reaction timing test, after
which I'll be allowed to drive unaccompanied, sort of.

<p>Although I've had my learner's permit for nearly two years now, I've long
procrastinated actually taking the assessments required to pass through the
four stages towards obtaining a full licence. I started learning on the family
car, which has a CVT, and that was pretty easy to pick up. I craved the idea of
being able to drive stick, but that wasn't realised until I acquired a new
Subaru Impreza to practise with. To say that it's absolutely brilliant and I
love it would be an understatement. The old automatic feels startlingly mundane
to drive now, as I must remind myself that there's nothing for my left foot or
hand to do.

<p>I set myself a goal of passing before my second year of university starts,
and I managed to meet that deadline by just a week. Some techniques were tricky
at first, like hill starts, but I quickly got the hang of it with the help of a
few lessons with Brad from <a href="http://allwestds.wix.com/home">Allwest
Driving School</a>. A friend of mine recommended him, and I would most
certainly do the same. All I can say is that he's experienced, professional,
friendly, and above all a very effective driving instructor. He's totally a top
bloke, and I'm not even shilling right now. That's really unethical and
potentially illegal; how could you accuse me of something like that?

<p>Also a welcome aid was Brad's recent choice of a Suzuki Swift as the basis
for his dual control training vehicle. It's trivial to drive, and impossible to
stall in my experience; when hill starting, you can find the friction point
every time even if it isn't yet established in muscle memory, as the front of
the car tends to lift up noticeably. Try that on my Impreza and you'll simply
stall it before any signs of the clutch engaging, which used to be a problem
for me back when I was still unfamiliar with clutch control.

<p>With all licensing centres booked out for tests until at least May or June,
I was feeling rather hopeless until Brad managed to snag a cancelled slot for
me in Willagee. Unlike the "flat as a pancake" Cannington, Willagee is very
hilly, but I took what I could get. The week before the test was pretty frantic
and stressful, as I tried to perfect my skills, or at least, the skills
assessed. It all paid off, to my great relief, and a nearly perfect score.

<p>The main challenge is over. Thanks to our state government's Department of
Transport, however, I'll still have to drive with a supervisor for at least six
months, and record 25 hours of this driving in a log book during this time.
Then I'll undergo a two year provisional period, in a quarter of which I will
be unable to drive for the five hours from midnight every day. Pretty confusing
stuff made worse by no federal consistency, and the rules have already changed
a couple of times since my permit. Stay tuned for August.
