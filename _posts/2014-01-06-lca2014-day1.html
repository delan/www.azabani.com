<p>The first day of my first technical conference has been one of the most truly
humbling and illuminating experiences I've had. It's rather late and I'll need
sleep very soon, but I can't simply buffer these thoughts for later. Every
speaker and attendee I met had something to share, in a true display of
community wisdom.

<p>Opening linux.conf.au was Dr Suelette Dreyfus, a researcher and journalist in
the field of surveillance and whistleblowing in the digital era. Formalising
public sentiment surrounding disclosures of governmental abuses of power, the
statistics clearly showed that the average citizen was in favour of actions by
whistleblowers in private and public organisations alike.

<p>Although she suggested pathways for action by the populace, her startlingly
poignant speech left me with a troublesome question: how do we continue to
resist current and future invasions of our privacy, while also encouraging the
integration of disparate government services for our convenience, when each
step is a potential opportunity for misuse?

<p>I had to take a raincheck on that thought afterwards, as the miniconfs
delivered an overwhelming five hours of content across a range of topics I was
often unfamiliar with, but had heard of their uses in the past. Now I'll need
to look into Puppet and Chef, as well as Jenkins, Vagrant, systemd, OpenStack
and more. Indifference towards modern tools and best practices seriously takes
its toll, after a surprisingly short period of time.

<p>One of the talks that stood out was Alan Robertson and the Assimilation
project. In between references such as "Resistance is Futile" and "The One Ring"
was a neat way to audit an entire network of workstations, servers, switches,
routers and other devices without constant network traffic.

<p>All of the Puppet and Chef talks woke me up to the world of automated
deployment, something that I hadn't touched beforehand, while Rodger Donaldson's
<i>The Six Stages of systemd</i> opened my mind, previously resistant to letting
go of System V init, to a declarative service management system with no
boilerplate and useful features such as support for automatic cgroups.

<p>Honourable mentions must also go to Thomas Sch√∂bel-Theuer, whose work on the
MARS block device replicator makes a huge leap in reliability over DRBD, Julien
Goodwin, who completely destroyed my incorrect understanding of Quality of
Service, and Phillip Smith, who demystified the arcane syntax of iptables
through his natural language wrapper, husk, while bearing the same Hurricane
Electric IPv6 shirt as I was today.

<p>However, the talk that took the cake for me was the final sysadmin miniconf
by Steven McDonald. To paraphrase, thinking inside the box is what you want 99%
of the time, except for that 1% where time is of the essence. Solutions for your
client are now in, and purity of those solutions is out. Just be sure to replace
your ugly hacks once the storm is over.

<p>Did I just mention nearly all of the miniconfs on the sysadmin track? Sorry
about that. I did manage to end this sweltering Perth summer's day with a "Birds
of a Feather" meeting for practical cryptography, which in a sense connects back
to the opening keynote.

<p>Tomorrow I'll have a very difficult time choosing between the Open
Programming and Linux kernel miniconfs, but at least I have the PGP key signing
party to look forward to.
