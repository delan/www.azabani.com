<p>Now that I have a website hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/"
>GitHub Pages</a>, I've been looking to rename <code>gh-pages</code> branches
back to <code>master</code> for some of my repositories so that the root URL
namespace isn't automatically polluted.

<p>Unfortunately, some of the solutions I found didn't work because GitHub doesn't allow deleting a repository's default branch. Based on Matthew Brett's
<a href="http://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/gh_delete_master.html"
>Deleting your master branch</a>, a working method for renaming branches is as
follows. Start by switching to your old branch, create a new branch based on it, then switch to the new branch:

<pre>git checkout $old_branch
git branch $new_branch
git checkout $new_branch</pre>

<p>Next, delete your old branch locally:

<pre>git branch -D $old_branch</pre>

<p>Now, push the new branch up to GitHub:

<pre>git push origin $new_branch</pre>

<p>Before you can delete the branch on GitHub, go to <code
>https://github.com/$user/$repo/settings</code> and change the default branch to
<code>$new_branch</code>. Finally, delete the old remote branch:

<pre>git push origin :$old_branch</pre>

<p>To rename a non-default branch, the process is actually the same, minus
changing the default branch on GitHub's repository settings page. If you're
using GitHub for Windows, it may fail to load the repository after renaming the
default branch; I simply deleted and recloned my local copy, although there is
almost certainly a cleaner way.
