title: Sidestepping NXDOMAIN hijacking

<p>Until May last year, I was a customer of name.com for a domain name and DNS
services. Having just grown out of a comfortable walled garden of all-in-one
shared hosting and DNS perhaps about a year prior, I knew little other than
that I should avoid GoDaddy. I since discovered that name.com was pulling a
scummy trick that an increasing number of name service providers engaged in.

<p>NXDOMAIN hijacking is not news now. Many ISPs and even OpenDNS have started
doing it, and while it not only breaks the DNS specifications and poses a
security risk, name.com's flippant responses and actions in holding customers
liable for name.com's automatically generated content are clearly unacceptable.
Specifically, the actions of name.com have been

<a href="http://nathanhammond.com/namedotcom-another-unscrupulous-registrar">quite</a>
<a href="http://www.taborcg.com/2010/05/06/name-com-host-typo-hijacking/">extensively</a>.

<p>That's not what this post is about though. You can easily avoid all of this
by switching to a vendor that isn't bad, such as Namecheap, Hover or Gandi. If
you stay with a provider like name.com, consider using something like <a href=
"https://dns.he.net/">Hurricane Electric's free DNS</a> service, which supports
IPv6 and includes the ability to run primary or secondary nameservers.

<p>Time to explore some commonly suggested technical workarounds provided to
users of the broken name services, for some fun and no profit. To begin, take
this output of <code>nslookup</code> which exhibits the issue:

<pre>
C:\Users\delan>nslookup notexistent.azabani.com.
Server:  resolv.on.ii.net
Address:  2001:44b8:1::1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    notexistent.azabani.com
Address:  174.37.172.71
</pre>

<p>A simplistic solution is to create wildcard A and AAAA records to IP
addresses guaranteed to never route nor reach a compliant networked device. RFC
3513 ยง 2.5.2 stipulates that the address <code>::</code> "must never be
assigned to any node". However, as you may expect, there are still addresses
returned by this method; any failure is in connection, not resolution.

<pre>
*	A	0.0.0.0
*	AAAA	::

C:\Users\delan>nslookup notexistent.azabani.com.
Server:  resolv.on.ii.net
Address:  2001:44b8:1::1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    notexistent.azabani.com
Addresses:  ::
          0.0.0.0
</pre>

<p>Interestingly, the presence of any type of record will disable address
hijacking, but the response will not actually be NXDOMAIN, but rather a NOERROR
with no answer records. You can see that by creating a TXT wildcard record.

<pre>
*	TXT	unused

C:\Users\delan>nslookup notexistent.azabani.com.
Server:  resolv.on.ii.net
Address:  2001:44b8:1::1

*** No internal type for both IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses (A+AAAA) records
available for notexistent
</pre>

<p>What does appear to do the trick is a wildcard CNAME to a target domain name
that will never resolve. RFC 2606 ยง 2 and the more recent RFC 6761 ยง 6.4
define <code>.invalid</code> as a reserved TLD which is guaranteed to neither
have any public domain registrations, nor ever be resolved by a compliant
server.

<pre>
*	CNAME	working.around.dns.hijacking.invalid

C:\Users\delan>nslookup notexistent.azabani.com.
Server:  resolv.on.ii.net
Address:  2001:44b8:1::1

*** resolv.on.ii.net can't find notexistent: Non-existent domain
</pre>
