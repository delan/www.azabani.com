title: Patriotic journalism is a farce

<p>If you were under the impression that Tony Abbott's political rhetoric
couldn't possibly get any more ridiculous, then take heed; you may just be
sorely mistaken. What appears to hit a nerve with our current prime minister
today is his <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-29/5224676"
>realisation</a> that our national public broadcaster won't simply prostrate
and assume the position of a partisan and corporate mouthpiece like Murdoch's
properties.

<p>Once again, our dear leader has simplified a vast array of complex
contemporary issues into false dichotomies. A few months ago it was <a href=
"//www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/baddies-abbott-rudd-syria-comments"
>goodies versus baddies</a>, and it's now us versus them, or rather,
Australia's side versus the unpatriotic ABC.

<p>As much as I have a disdain for the overused term, startlingly Orwellian is
his claim that “the ABC instinctively takes everyone's side but Australia's”,
and the corresponding implication that there should be an “Australian side” to
be preferred by journalists.

<p>Abbott <a href=
"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/20140129-31lt8.html"
>also said</a>, “You would like the national broadcaster to have a rigorous
commitment to truth and at least some basic affection for the home team”. In
the real world however, the truth and a nationalistic sense of basic affection
for one's country do not always go hand in hand; in fact they frequently assume
conflicting positions.

<p>Of course, let's not forget the incorrect conflation of the political
ideology of the Coalition with the interests of Australians in general. Even
more concerning are his comments about the damning information revealed by
Edward Snowden over the past year:

<blockquote>The ABC seemed to delight in broadcasting allegations by a traitor
[...] The ABC didn't just report what he said, they took the lead in
advertising what he said, and that was a deep concern.</blockquote>

<p>The difference between “reporting” and “advertising” the evidence yielded by
the leaks appears to be no more than one of vocabulary. I have no idea how one
would even measure “delight” taken in reporting the leaks, but if anything, the
evidence is a necessary embarrassment to the countries involved, not something
that anyone has celebrated.

<p>The far more grave fallacy, however, is that where Abbott implies not only
that the application of United States law is equivalent to a universal moral
judgement, but also that the charges brought against him under these laws
diminish the validity or significance of his whistleblowing — but the evidence
will not simply relent.

<p>If one wanted to make an argument against government whistleblowing, with
some effort they could posit that, for instance, unredacted leaks could
threaten the safety of overseas operatives with secret identities, or the
efficacy of military operations relying on confidential tactical and strategic
data. Debatable, but a good start. Alas, the best our prime minister could
conujure was a vacuous argumentum ad hominem.

<p>Our politics are a caricature without an artist when the head of government
empathises and confides with shock jock radio personalities like Jones and
Hadley. Although I think that the left wing–right wing model is far too
one-dimensional for Australian politics, it suffices to use it here to say that
if the Coalition sees “left-wing bias” everywhere, perhaps the message is that
they are the ones who are backed deep into a right-wing corner.

<p>It is possible that the political aims of the incumbent government may be
better served by maintaining a healthy dialogue with the public. Simplex
streams of propaganda through ideologically sympathetic media outlets are not
enough and never have been, nor is it acceptable to be consistently opaque
under the guise of <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/20131109-2x8a1.html"
>“operational matters”</a>.

<p>Then again, an increase in public knowledge of a government's actions may
degrade just as likely as improve the reputation of the government, and that's
exactly how it should be — the people employ the administration, not the
converse.
