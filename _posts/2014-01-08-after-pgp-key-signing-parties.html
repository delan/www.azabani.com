title: After PGP key signing parties

<p>Yesterday I attended a PGP key signing BoF session at linux.conf.au. Being
a novice at PGP, and never having done this before, it took me a couple of
tries to get the actual signing process right after the party. Here's what I
learned, and how you should do it. Probably.

<p>I used a fresh installation of Debian, and a similar setup will be assumed
for the remainder of this post. This leads naturally into a disclaimer: as I'm
using a VM solely for party signing, and this is a quick dump of what I've done,
please don't follow this blindly in a home directory with your complete
keyrings, etc.

<p>Start by installing <code>caff</code>:

<pre># apt-get install signing-party</pre>

<p><code>exim4</code> will be automatically installed for email support, but
it won't work until configured. Assuming you're using Gmail or Google Apps:

<pre># dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config</pre>

<ul>
	<li><code>mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail</code>
	<li>System mail name: <code>localhost</code>
	<li>IP addresses to listen on: <code>127.0.0.1</code>
	<li>Other destinations: empty
	<li>Machines to relay mail for: empty
	<li>Outgoing smarthost: <code>smtp.gmail.com::587</code>
	<li>Hide local mail name: NO
	<li>Minimise DNS queries: NO
	<li>Delivery method: <code>mbox format in /var/mail/</code>
	<li>Split configuration: YES
</ul>

<p>If you use two-factor authentication, generate and use an
application-specific password here now; your primary password will not work.

<pre>
# LOCALUSER='delan'
# EMAILADDR='delan@azabani.com'
# EMAILPW='...'
# echo "*.google.com:$EMAILADDR:$EMAILPW" >> /etc/exim4/passwd.client
# echo "$LOCALUSER: $EMAILADDR' >> /etc/email-addresses
# echo "$LOCALUSER@localhost: $EMAILADDR' >> /etc/email-addresses
# echo "$LOCALUSER@$HOSTNAME: $EMAILADDR' >> /etc/email-addresses
# echo "$LOCALUSER@$HOSTNAME.localdomain: $EMAILADDR' >> /etc/email-addresses
# update-exim4.conf
# invoke-rc.d exim4 restart
</pre>

<p>Send a testing email to yourself to make sure the mail server actually
works, ending your message entered on stdin by pressing <code>^D</code>:

<pre>
$ mail -s 'Testing exim4 configuration' delan@azabani.com
Hello, world!
</pre>

<p>Now that the mail server is configured, set up caff and gnupg. The former is
pretty simple, just add something like this to <code>~/.caffrc</code>:

<pre>
$CONFIG{'owner'} = 'Delan Azabani';
$CONFIG{'email'} = 'delan@azabani.com';
$CONFIG{'keyid'} = [ qw{0548747618416AA7} ];
</pre>

<p>Now you'll need to add <code>ask-cert-level</code> to <code>gpg.conf</code>
if you want to be able to create <code>sig3</code> trusted signatures (which
you should only do if your party carefully checked photo identification). The
<code>keyserver</code> declaration is simply because I prefer MIT's PGP
keyserver.

<pre>
$ echo 'ask-cert-level' >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
$ echo 'keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu' >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
</pre>

<p>It's probably a bad idea, but if you want to temporarily remove your private
key's passphrase to make signing easier, do this:

<pre>
$ gpg --edit-key Delan
gpg> passwd
gpg> save
</pre>

<p>If you do, remember to secure it again afterwards, of course. Now import the
public keys you want with gpg, and set up caff to read from <code
>~/.gnupg/</code>:

<pre>
$ caff
$ for i in `ls .gnupg`; do ln -sv ~/.gnupg/$i ~/.caff/gnupghome/$i; done
</pre>

<p>Finally, run <code>caff</code> on the key IDs you want to sign:

<pre>$ caff --no-download $KEYID1 $KEYID2 ... $KEYIDn</pre>

<p>If you want to push your signatures to a public keyserver immediately,
you'll first need to copy caff's <code>pubring.gpg</code> back to <code
>~/.gnupg/</code> because it replaces the symlink with a separate file.

<pre>
$ cp -v ~/.caff/gnupghome/pubring.gpg ~/.gnupg/
$ gpg --send-keys $KEYID1 $KEYID2 ... $KEYIDn
</pre>
