<p>Rarely is reimplementing your performance-critical code in C the best
initial approach to optimisation. Most of the time, the fruit lies in the
time complexities of the algorithms used. Request routing is one of these
situations, where PHP developer Nikita Popov cleverly leverages the regex
engine by bundling together chunks of route patterns, greatly reducing the
number of iterations to dispatch to a handler.
