<p><a href="http://www.matasano.com/">Matasano Security</a>, founded by leading
Hacker News user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tptacek">Thomas
Ptacek</a>, is running an email-based cryptography <a
href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/">exercise suite</a>.
Perhaps it's a hiring tool, or a survey of programmer competency, but either
way it's definitely very educational.

<p>Just over a week ago, reading <a
href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/">Maciej
Cegłowski's experience</a> completing the challenges inspired me to look into
improving my crypto skills beyond the near zero I have now. Sure I can, for
instance, retell some oft-repeated best and worst practices for storing
passwords, but there's no way I could design a cryptosystem that's more secure
than a wicker basket.

<p>Cegłowski reflects how I feel to the bit:

<blockquote>Much of what I know (or think I know) about security has come from
reading tptacek's comments on Hacker News, so I was intrigued when I first saw
him mention the security challenges a few months ago. At the same time, I
worried that I'd be way out of my depth attempting them.</blockquote>

<p>I've just started the first set of eight problems, and it doesn't look too
far-fetched yet. Relevant concepts like base64, XOR, simple cipher modes and
(using) AES seem reasonably familiar, if not things I've worked with before.

<p>Right now, I'm agonising over the elegance of my code, whether I should do
everything in C or <code>$LANGUAGE</code> or pick up a new language for each
exercise just for fun, and various other ways I can impress the real human
eyeballs that are going to read my code. I suspect that soon, I won't be able
to; after all, they are <i>challenges</i>.

<p>You should do it too, if only purely for the fun. Simply email <a
href="mailto:cryptopals@matasano.com">cryptopals@matasano.com</a> to start. The
challenges probably won't run forever, and the hardest part is keeping your
solutions to yourself.
