<p>ComSSA's public website has been left untouched for years, and lacked vital
information for potential and current members. Nothing fancy, all we need is
location, contact, membership and event information. I've been delegated the
task of setting up a new website for the club, and I've discovered a fair bit
on the first night.

<p>Previously, we had used an ASP.NET shared hosting provider, which was
definitely overkill. We've halved our ongoing costs by switching to <a
href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>, gaining the flexibility of
a Linux VPS with root in the process. My first impressions are positive; I
especially like the ability to create, reimage and destroy droplets (their
term for a VPS) in 60 seconds each.

<p>At the moment, I'm using a <a href="https://github.com/delan/comssa"
>hacky shell script on GitHub</a> to consistently manage the server's
initial configuration. This is a really bad idea, especially so given the
existence of Puppet, Chef, etc. Have I learned nothing from #lca2014? This is
all temporary, I promise. *

<p>As DigitalOcean does not currently provide IPv6 connectivity, Hurricane
Electric comes to the rescue with its <a href="https://tunnelbroker.net"
>Tunnelbroker service</a>. To my surprise, you receive an allocation of not
only a /64, but a /48 as well, all to yourself. Holy cavalier distribution of
addresses, Batman! I'm not sure if I feel good or bad about this. I think it's
both, like a guilty pleasure.

<p>Configuration in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> was dead easy:

<pre>
auto he-ipv6
iface he-ipv6 inet6 v4tunnel
address 2001:470:7c85::1
netmask 48
endpoint 216.66.84.46
ttl 255
gateway 2001:470:1f14:116e::1
</pre>

<p>DigitalOcean's free DNS service is pretty but lacks the ability to even
create AAAA records, which is annoying. Thankfully, Hurricane Electric also
provides a <a href="https://dns.he.net">free DNS service</a>, which I've used
in the past as a secondary nameserver network.

<p>It appeared that <i>reverse</i> DNS to tunnel addresses only worked for the
/48 but not the /64, but a few emails back and forth fixed the issue. Even
though being forced to use the subnet that's 65536 times as large isn't really
a big problem, I'm impressed at the support turnaround of under an hour.

<p>One small problem I'm yet to work out is why <a
href="https://github.com/delan/lookout">lookout</a> is returning the wrong
FQDN, now that I've set up reverse DNS for both IPv4 and IPv6. Although that
looks like the remedy here, I can't switch to using <code
>socket.gethostname()</code> because on Windows, that yields the NetBIOS name,
and <code>socket.getfqdn()</code> is the correct method to use.

<pre>
ling% dig -x 146.185.129.226 | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION' | tail -1
226.129.185.146.in-addr.arpa. 12707 IN  PTR     ling.comssa.org.au.
ling% dig -x 2001:470:7c85::1 | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION' | tail -1
1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.5.8.c.7.0.7.4.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.
    20015 IN PTR ling.comssa.org.au.
ling% python
>>> socket.getfqdn()
'comssa-1-pt.tunnel.tserv11.ams1.ipv6.he.net'
>>> socket.gethostname()
'ling.comssa.org.au'
</pre>

<p>The last seven hours have been an interesting ride. It's only now occurred
to me that I haven't started working on the actual website itself. Not to
worry, stay tuned and it will debut in the next few weeks. Hopefully.
