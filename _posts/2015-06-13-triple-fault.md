I [sought treatment][help] for [depression and anxiety][depression]
just over three months ago, while trying in futility to continue living
my life with minimal disruption. My counsellor and my friends convinced
me to trudge onwards through the final year of my university course,
and in fairness, it was worth a shot. I had an excellent career with
Atlassian lined up, with no less than a signed contract, and all I
needed to do was simply graduate. As difficult as it was to commit to
this decision, I need to devote the rest of this year to my health,
during when I can reset my mind without external pressure.

## Aberration

I may need to quit my internship with Diamond Cyber. This doesn't just
hurt because they're such a skilled and diverse team to work with, and
I'd lose the opportunity to train myself in the real infosec industry
so early. This hurts because it mirrors the story of my internship last
year, where I quit after less than two months, then due to anxiety, now
due to depression. The symmetry between these repeated failures is
terribly frustrating.

I won't be attending either of my exams, and while this may be tinted
by my cognitive biases, I don't think that attempting them this
semester is worth the effort. Given my current state, I'm adamant that
I would not pass *Artificial and Machine Intelligence*, and the only
way I could pass *Fundamental Concepts of Cryptography* is if I managed
to capture an elusive day of lucidity --- a species so mythical that
I'd be generous to have seen five of them in the last three months ---
between now and its exam.

While it has no exam component, the *Software Engineering Project* is
also a lost cause for me. Students are expected to invest 10--20 hours
into their projects weekly, but I've only yielded about ten hours of
productivity for my team overall, and that's with rounding to the
nearest ten hours too. My team members are both incredibly capable
students, and they did very well without my help, but I feel awful
knowing that were I healthy, I could've brought a similarly capable
mind to our proverbial table. Instead I occupied a third spot in our
team that could've gone to someone that was actually useful.

I'm applying for a *Withdrawal Under Special Circumstances* for all of
the units in which I'm enrolled, and a *Leave of Absence* for the next
semester. The latter is fairly easy to obtain approval for, while the
former generally requires a professional letter of recommendation as
supporting evidence. The letter would essentially need to assert that I
had a chance of passing the units before the Census Date, and this only
changed after said date. I'm reasonably confident that my counsellor
will support my application when I see her fourteen days from now, but
I have no idea what I'll do if she refuses. Relying on a personal
statement, general medical certificate, or course coordinator's
statement seems far less likely to allow me to substitute withdrawn
grades for failure grades.

I know little else with complete certainty than two consequences. I
won't be able to graduate until at least the end of the second semester
next year, and I won't be able to join seven of my current Curtin peers
at Atlassian next year. Don't get me wrong, this is a huge blow, which
is why a handful of my friends persuaded me to persevere, but at this
point I think it would be both unrealistic and irresponsible to do
anything other than clear my mind and work on my health. "Slow and
steady wins the race" feels appropriate here.

## Debilitation

I haven't qualified "health" as "mental health" thus far, because
mental illness doesn't operate in an isolated system. I can't think,
but I also can't sleep, and these form a vicious cycle. I have no
energy, but I also can't eat, and these form another. I grow lonely,
but my fear that the people I care about will grow bored of my antics
only pulls me further away from these people when I need them the most,
and so on.

It now seems nearly impossible to remember what it was like to "feel
normal" and see myself as a healthy person with a heterogeneous and
lucid mind. I'm seeing someone who's brilliant on so many levels, and
whose affection is orders of magnitude more efficacious than any
medication I've been prescribed, and yet my online dating profile
remains live, because its fields serve as a handy reference guide that
prevents me from forgetting who I'm *supposed* to be and what I'm
*supposed* to be interested in doing with my life.

I'm ultimately losing my ability to even *function* as a human of
reasonable physical health, but a solid physical foundation is exactly
the environment that I need to effectively climb out of depression, and
the last seventeen months of my life that I've more or less wasted.

I've broken down several times, and I've wept for the first time in
several years. While crying was cathartic, and regaining my ability to
do so was positive, these episodes take a toll of their own. I'm
depleted, lonely, and universally apathetic.

## Medication

One of the two major components of the modern consensus on the
treatment of depression and anxiety is medication. I've hopped between
medications a handful of times, but sadly I expect to undergo more
changes before I find a combination that works well for me. I've tried
to keep track of my benefical and adverse experiences in a spreadsheet,
without which I would quickly lose track of the nuances of each drug.

For nearly six weeks from the start of March, I took 10 mg of
escitalopram oxalate daily, a reasonable choice given that it's at
least as effective as, and frequently better than many other
contemporary monoamine reuptake inhibitors in regard to efficacy and
acceptability (Cipriani et al., 2009). Even across drug classes, it's
among the most affordable (Wessling & Ramsberg, 2008) and safe 
(White et al., 2008) antidepressants. My symptoms of depression
improved marginally, while anxiety has diminished to an impressive
degree. Aside from significant sexual dysfunction, narcolepsy, and
insomnia, the only adverse effects that persisted were whimsical, such
as a restlessness of my limbs.

As the weeks passed, I developed what I'd describe as both insomnia and
narcolepsy, where my sleep cycle alternated between either being
completely unpredictable or halved in frequency, staying awake for 30
hours, and sleeping for 18 hours at a time. When I was awake, I would
intermittently and inevitably fall asleep several times a day. I wasn't
surprised to see no improvements when introducing caffeine, as I've
never noticed any eugeroic or stimulant effects from it. The symptoms
of narcolepsy were resolved with modafinil, and later armodafinil, an
enantiopure derivative with a more favourable plasma concentration
curve, but I'm still struggling with an unreliable ability to sleep.

Not satisfied, I switched to 30 mg of duloxetine hydrochloride daily.
As an SNRI, there was early evidence (Thase et al., 2001) to suggest
that it may be superior to an SSRI via studies comparing venlafaxine
against fluvoxamine and sertraline. Some later studies compared
duloxetine favourably against escitalopram, although most of those that
I found (Nierenberg et al., 2007; Pigott et al., 2007) were sponsored
by Eli Lilly. Khan et al. (2007) found that "escitalopram has better
tolerability and comparable efficacy relative to duloxetine", but I
take most studies about antidepressants with a flagfall grain of salt
anyway, especially given their durations generally being very short.

The first time I switched to duloxetine, I did so abruptly on the
advice of my doctor, even though I raised concerns that switching from
an SSRI to an SNRI would indicate a tapering period. That week was a
genuinely awful experience that included my first serious breakdown, so
I switched back to escitalopram until I contracted food poisoning in
late May, where I was incapacitated for just over a week. Having taken
neither during that period, I'm giving duloxetine another shot to see
if it will work for me.

I'm not self-medicating though, as I have appointments with another
doctor and my counsellor scheduled in the next fortnight. I've been
told that I may need to start seeing a psychiatrist, which was quite
startling, as my thoughts upon hearing that made me reflect upon how
I've gradually let depression encroach upon and define my identity, but
also how there are still stigmata attached to mental illness that even
I need to unlearn.

Other medications which may be promising from my cursory research
include bupropion, which Serretti and Chiesa (2009) found to be
particularly favourable in regard to sexual adverse side effects,
mirtazapine, clomipramine, and moclobemide, a reversible MAOI.
Nevertheless, I'm still early into what will be a long journey. These
other drugs could also bring with them a decreased tolerability due to
their less selective nature.

## Reflection

I apologise most genuinely to anyone around me who I've bored by
discussing my mental health so frequently and openly. Even I somewhat
resent how what I'm going through has made me appear seemingly
one-dimensional, but I suppose it's more healthy than vigilantly
keeping it all to myself. Whether or not an apology is requisite is
debatable, but I long more than anyone for a time when I can simply
feel normal and healthy.

One of the phenomena I wanted to write about the most is how I've felt
guilty when finding a rare day of lucidity, particularly when I've
spent it doing something against which I have "better things to do" by
the standards of others, whatever that means. It's a train of thought
that I need to avoid, particularly as I take the second half of this
year off university in an effort to make my life normal once again.

Since I've started writing about my mental health a few months ago,
I've spoken to multiple friends who are currently going through
depression too, and it goes without saying that the shared prism of
experience has helped bring us closer to one another. While I thought
that I'd be able to provide unique and pertinent answers to help them
with what they're going through, I'm actually nearly as helpless. I'm
in the same ostensibly helpless boat as they are, and that is what
disheartens me the most.

I'm alive every day, but I'm not living every day. I'm here because I'm
so apathetic about everything at this point that even the idea of
committing suicide does not provide me with any appeal. More
positively, I still have a small amount of hope that life will improve.
Whatever ends up happening though, I've still got a long road ahead.
