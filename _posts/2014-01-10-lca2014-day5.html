title: linux.conf.au 2014, day 5&#58; sockets, satellites and scaling

<p>I suppose that's it. As I've mentioned, linux.conf.au, my first technical
conference, can only be described as a rollercoaster that was over too soon
looking back. I've learned more from experts in open source communities in
these last five days than I probably have in months of my own accord. Let's
take a look at the last day.

<p>Lennart Poettering's <i>D-Bus in the kernel</i> woke me up to a blind spot
in my knowledge: inter-process communication. Linux is apparently unlike most
other modern operating systems in that the kernel only provides IPC primitives
such as sockets, FIFOs and shared memory, but no richer interfaces built on
them.

<p>That's where D-Bus aims to fill the gap, and among other things, moving it
into the kernel will help improve performance (message copies, validations and
context switches) from 10/4/4 to 2/2/2 for a full-duplex message.
Radical. Impressive.

<p><i>Simple DIY Engine Management for simple software hackers</i> by Josh
Stewart showed that it's possible to make an inexpensive, hacker-friendly
engine management system for passenger vehicles using an Arduino. I'm
nevertheless slightly concerned about an increase in natural selection
occurring given bad inputs to the programmable microcontroller.

<p>Rusty Russell proposes an alternative transaction network for Bitcoin that
makes some compromises to reliability of verification in favour of a system
that will scale far more easily through to a future of 100,000 transactions
per second and higher.

<p>Concluding the conference, Jason Cook drilled down to the most effective
means of tuning TCP in the kernel, sofware and hardware to achieve optimal
performance for the Web and similar network traffic patterns.

<p>The next two linux.conf.au events will be held in Auckland and Geelong
respectively, so I suppose I'd better start saving up now. Good night, fellow
hackers!
