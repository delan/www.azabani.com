<p>Perhaps the only channel I bother watching television for anymore is ABC
News 24. I could probably eschew using an actual television for that, too, as a
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/abcnews24/">live stream</a> is provided
online. The channel has finally dropped backwards compatibility with 4:3
displays, taking another step in the constant march of deprecation.

<p>While compatibility was previously maintained by using only the 4:3 safe
area for text, the "flipper" ticker, watermark and clock have now stretched
their metaphorical legs to take advantage of the entire 16:9 horizontal space:

<p><a href="/images/abc24ws1.jpg"
   ><img class="post_image_half" src="/images/abc24ws1.jpg"></a
   ><a href="/images/abc24ws2.jpg"
   ><img class="post_image_half" src="/images/abc24ws2.jpg"></a>

<p>Story headlines and their brief descriptions are still kept within 4:3, though if this does not also change in the future, I suspect it will be kept so
that a reasonable line length is maintained, for ease of reading.

<p>Arguably a true, horizontally scrolling ticker would be better going
forward, as the lack of "lines" makes line length a non-issue. However, I
personally find these types of tickers to provide excessive visual pollution
due to the constant movement.

<p>It is strange that the watermark and clock were moved out about a month ago,
and only now has the change been complemented with the ticker. The asymmetry
was quite jarring.

<p>Stranger still to me, is why 4:3 compatibility would be provided at all, for
a channel that has only ever been available in 720p DVB-T. Perhaps the channel
was delivered internationally to broadcasters without exclusive use of
widescreen, or some set top boxes are used with old CRTs, cropping the viewable
area. I still see countless old TVs at every verge collection.

<p>I am completely in favour of television broadcasts making use of widescreen
to a greater extent â€” after all, not only have we had it here in Australia
since free-to-air DVB-T was introduced in 2001, but the cessation of analogue
PAL broadcasts nationally has <a href="http://www.digitalready.gov.au/"
>completed</a> just under two months ago. Rest in peace, 4:3, you probably
won't be missed.
