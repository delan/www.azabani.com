The culture of building 314 can, at times, be an echo chamber that
isn’t really conducive to nuance or reason, and when that happens,
it’s more than a literal breath of fresh air to step through that
glass door, out of the dilapidated hallway of a gravely neglected
computing department, and back into the real world.

There’s always a set of people who are unfortunate enough to be on the
“shit list” of the collective consciousness of the floor. Some of our
lecturers are on it — I’m sure you won’t have to think too hard for a
few of them to spring to mind — as are some of our tutors, and some
of our peers.

If you’re on the list, there are quite a few of us who would find it
easier to only ever talk about you in a negative light. I can’t say
that I’ve never been guilty of it. It can be easier to set aside the
complexity of paying attention to all of the strengths, weaknesses,
successes, and failures that shape a person.

Taking that complexity into account makes it harder to spin up yet
another session of complaining — and talking shit — about a person.
These sessions can be cathartic if, for example, we share a bunch of
grievances about a lecturer. These sessions can feel rewarding, if not
pleasurable, if we allow ourselves to mutually ostracise some people,
in service of our ability to feel like we’re part of the community.

Nuance isn’t welcome in these sessions, because it usually makes them
less effective. Play the double’s avocado for a unit that’s on the
list by suggesting an example of a student who did find it useful,
and like any thoughts that threaten the consistency of the accepted
narrative, their opinions are dismissed without a second thought.
We tell stories, old and new, about why a person on the list is an
obnoxious idiot, and these stories gradually evolve over time, eroding
any components that are superfluous to the goal of condemnation, let
alone those that serve as obstacles to their punch lines.

In other words, the echo chamber becomes a tool, and as the most
developed of the primates by far, we’re the pioneering experts on
the design and optimisation of tools. Sickly is the community that
is defined, even in part, by whether or not you loathe the “correct”
people. Until we decide to stop approving of it, or condoning it
through inaction, we will inevitably make this tool as efficient
as possible, no matter the cost.
