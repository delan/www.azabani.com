<p>Exploiting an admittedly embarrassing lack of specificity in the NBN rollout
contracts for Tasmania, executive chairman Switkowski continues to push for the
massive dead-end gyp that would be buying or renting Telstra's long perished
copper network. “We can have an intellectual argument about the benefits of
fibre versus copper, but I think it is quite academic. I don't think it's a
real world issue.”
