<p>Alternatively, <i>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love UTC</i>. It was a
little more subtle than I had expected to ensure that Jekyll uses an arbitrary
timezone for dates in posts and their generated URLs, but is that even a Good
Thingâ„¢ to do?

<p>My posts were timestamped in their YAML front matter like so:

<pre>date: 2014-01-03 07:00:00 +0800</pre>

<p>Then I tried adding this to <code>_config.yml</code>:

<pre>timezone: Australia/Perth</pre>

<p>It appeared that this had no effect at all. URLs were still being generated
based on the date in UTC, and displayed post dates were still:

<pre>2014-01-02 23:00 UTC</pre>

<p>Technically the same date, but not quite what I wanted. After emailing
GitHub and receiving very quick and friendly responses, it turns out that both
the timezone offset and <i>the seconds</i> must be omitted:

<pre>date: 2014-01-03 07:00</pre>

<p>However, in the time that passed, I realised that doing this would actually
be short-sighted; it would lock this website into one timezone. Not permanently,
perhaps, but one would have to use the same timezone for all posts.

<p>What if, one day, I decide that Perth no longer has the same homely charm,
and I grow tired of living in a city where absolutely nothing happens? Heresy,
I know, but it's possible.

<p>As an aside, when doing the above, the displayed post dates would be like:

<pre>2014-01-03 07:00 Aus</pre>

<p>Perhaps using <code>%Z</code> in Jekyll simply takes the first three
characters of the tzdata name.

<p>Just stick with UTC.
