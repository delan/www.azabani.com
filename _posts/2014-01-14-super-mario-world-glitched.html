<p>How do you complete Super Mario World in under two minutes without
exploiting an emulator bug? Clearly, the answer is to execute arbitrary code
that was programmed via the controller ports, says Masterjun. If you've got an
extra minute to spare, why not <a href="http://youtu.be/OPcV9uIY5i4">play
Pong and Snake</a> while you're at it?
