<p>Craig at <code>/dev/ttyS0</code> cracks open a Linksys WRT120N to find out
just what has been done to obfuscate the firmware. Using SPI to dump the raw
flash data, and cleverly combining binwalk and IDA, he uncovers just what has
been done to the images and even creates a tool to reverse the obfuscation.
