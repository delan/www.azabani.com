Subject: [PATCH] Fix erroneously small write for OUT_REL4ADR

Ensure that the int64_t offset value, which ultimately comes from an
int64_t value in gencode() (assemble.c:1906), is completely written to
the temporary buffer, instead of merely its least significant 32 bits.

Prior to this change, WRITELONG was used instead of WRITEDLONG, which
resulted in add_reloc being passed an int64_t "reloff" whose least
significant 32 bits were those from the aforementioned offset value,
and whose most significant 32 bits were stack garbage from "mydata".

This led to get_closest_section_symbol_by_offset() attempting to search
for extremely large values of "offset" among the symbols in "syms",
which meant that the last symbol with a matching section number would
always win the symbol search.

In effect, this clobbered the resultant relocation information, such
that all entries would be resolved with the same symbol.
