Subject: [PATCH] /etc/netstart: autoconfigure the interfaces given in argv
Message-Id: <20150910203710.78F3313C12BB@NeXTSTEP.local>
Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2015 04:37:09 +0800 (AWST)

I've written a patch to ensure that /etc/netstart executes ifconfig
inet6 autoconf, even when interfaces are specified as arguments.

I've updated my patch for revision 1.153 of /etc/netstart from the
revision 1.144 that my original patch was based on.

To the best of my judgement, this patch will also fix a bug. As far as
I can tell, $rtsolif is an IFS list that accumulates interfaces to be
autoconfigured after two of the ifmstart calls. The old code executed

ifconfig $rtsolif inet6 autoconf

which would theoretically break if $rtsolif consisted of multiple
interfaces (cf. ifconfig em0 em0 em0 inet6 autoconf).

Relative to the original patch, this patch also does a better job of
preserving the semantics of $rtsolif as a list of interfaces to be
autoconfigured after ifstart.

To minimise the amount of code that I needed to change, the check that
is used for $ip6kernel is repeated, but its runtime is negligible.

Feedback would be much appreciated :)
