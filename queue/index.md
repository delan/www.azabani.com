## Write

  * More notes on OpenBSD — OpenGL with `machdep.allowaperture=0`,
    `if=athn0` in `/etc/rc.d/wpa_supplicant`, `family inet6 inet4` in
    `/etc/resolv.conf`, etc.
  * Brief security analysis of CellOPark — including definite storage of
    passwords in plain text, password complexity restrictions, refer to
    email correspondence
  * Mainboard floppy drive controller pinout variations — pins 3, 4, 5,
    or no pins dropped, refer to email to Scott Mueller for details
  * Taxonomy of prevalent and rare CLI option parsing styles
  * Analysis of the Melbourne Curriculum (formerly the Melbourne Model)
    — the role of universities as institutions for vocational education
    versus intellectual enlightenment versus producers of research,
    the conflicts between the interests of students, employers, and
    university administrations, as well as a detailed comparison of
    computing and mathematics degrees from a range of Australian
    universities (Curtin, UWA, Melbourne, Monash, UNSW, Sydney, etc.)
  * *Super Solvers: Gizmos & Gadgets!* strategy guide
  * IPv6 addressing quirks — `randomizeidentifiers` on Windows versus
    RFC 4941, OpenWRT Barrier Breaker assignment policy versus RFC 7084
  * The semantics of Adaptec's JBOD mode — how it seems to happen to
    work on existing drives only if they're MBR, but corrupt GPT drives
  * Junctioning `%PROGRAMFILES%` on Windows 7, Windows 8,
    and Windows 8.1 — what breaks including .NET Framework 3.5, Modern
    apps, and certain security updates
  * VPN and network privacy at Curtin — what works out of SOCKS,
    OpenVPN, PPTP, L2TP, SSTP, and IPsec, and performance optimisations
  * TLS configuration guide — what's good for Qualys SSL Labs versus
    target audience needs, less relevant now that *Bulletproof SSL and
    TLS* exists
  * Delegation of responsibilities between modern CPU and chipset
    architectures
  * Using Computer Modern on the web — rendering quality on Windows
    mostly remains an unsolved problem, having seen the currently
    available conversions
  * Guide to vertical scaling on x86 with 8S systems
  * Words and phrases with simultaneously opposite semantics — arguably
    a fine line
  * That strange backlight behaviour on the LG IPS231
